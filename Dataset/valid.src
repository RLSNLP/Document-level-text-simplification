the pupil is a black hole located in the center of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina . it appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly , or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil . the term “pupil” was created by gerard of cremona.in humans , the pupil is round , but its shape varies between species ; some cats , reptiles , and foxes have vertical slit pupils , goats have horizontally oriented pupils , and some catfish have annular types . in optical terms , the anatomical pupil is the eye 's aperture and the iris is the aperture stop . the image of the pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil , which does not exactly correspond to the location and size of the physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea . on the inner edge lies a prominent structure , the collarette , marking the junction of the embryonic pupillary membrane covering the embryonic pupil .

in finance , the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) is a model used to determine a theoretically appropriate required rate of return of an asset , to make decisions about adding assets to a well-diversified portfolio.the model takes into account the asset 's sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk ( also known as systematic risk or market risk ) , often represented by the quantity beta ( β ) in the financial industry , as well as the expected return of the market and the expected return of a theoretical risk-free asset . capm assumes a particular form of utility functions ( in which only first and second moments matter , that is risk is measured by variance , for example a quadratic utility ) or alternatively asset returns whose probability distributions are completely described by the first two moments ( for example , the normal distribution ) and zero transaction costs ( necessary for diversification to get rid of all idiosyncratic risk ) . under these conditions , capm shows that the cost of equity capital is determined only by beta . despite it failing numerous empirical tests , and the existence of more modern approaches to asset pricing and portfolio selection ( such as arbitrage pricing theory and merton 's portfolio problem ) , the capm still remains popular due to its simplicity and utility in a variety of situations . 
rna splicing , in molecular biology , is a form of rna processing in which a newly made precursor messenger rna ( pre-mrna ) transcript is transformed into a mature messenger rna ( mrna ) . during splicing , introns ( non-coding regions ) are removed and exons ( coding regions ) are joined together . for nuclear-encoded genes , splicing takes place within the nucleus either during or immediately after transcription . for those eukaryotic genes that contain introns , splicing is usually required in order to create an mrna molecule that can be translated into protein . for many eukaryotic introns , splicing is carried out in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome , a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snrnps ) . self-splicing introns , or ribozymes capable of catalyzing their own excision from their parent rna molecule , also exist .

gödel 's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that demonstrate the inherent limitations of every formal axiomatic system capable of modelling basic arithmetic . these results , published by kurt gödel in 1931 , are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics . the theorems are widely , but not universally , interpreted as showing that hilbert 's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.the first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure ( i.e. , an algorithm ) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers . for any such consistent formal system , there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true , but that are unprovable within the system . the second incompleteness theorem , an extension of the first , shows that the system can not demonstrate its own consistency.employing a diagonal argument , gödel 's incompleteness theorems were the first of several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems . they were followed by tarski 's undefinability theorem on the formal undefinability of truth , church 's proof that hilbert 's entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable , and turing 's theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the halting problem .

a steroid is a biologically active organic compound with four rings arranged in a specific molecular configuration . steroids have two principal biological functions : as important components of cell membranes which alter membrane fluidity ; and as signaling molecules . hundreds of steroids are found in plants , animals and fungi . all steroids are manufactured in cells from the sterols lanosterol ( opisthokonts ) or cycloartenol ( plants ) . lanosterol and cycloartenol are derived from the cyclization of the triterpene squalene.the steroid core structure is typically composed of seventeen carbon atoms , bonded in four `` fused '' rings : three six-member cyclohexane rings ( rings a , b and c in the first illustration ) and one five-member cyclopentane ring ( the d ring ) . steroids vary by the functional groups attached to this four-ring core and by the oxidation state of the rings . sterols are forms of steroids with a hydroxy group at position three and a skeleton derived from cholestane . steroids can also be more radically modified , such as by changes to the ring structure , for example , cutting one of the rings . cutting ring b produces secosteroids one of which is vitamin d.examples include the lipid cholesterol , the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone , and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone .

jerry alan fodor ( ; april 22 , 1935 – november 29 , 2017 ) was an american philosopher and cognitive scientist . he held the position of state of new jersey professor of philosophy , emeritus , at rutgers university and was the author of many works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science , in which he laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses , among other ideas . he was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation and as `` one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century . in addition to having exerted an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960 , fodor 's work has had a significant impact on the development of the cognitive sciences . `` fodor argued that mental states , such as beliefs and desires , are relations between individuals and mental representations . he maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought ( lot ) in the mind . furthermore , this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool . fodor adhered to a species of functionalism , maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.for fodor , significant parts of the mind , such as perceptual and linguistic processes , are structured in terms of modules , or `` organs '' , which he defines by their causal and functional roles . these modules are relatively independent of each other and of the `` central processing '' part of the mind , which has a more global and less `` domain specific '' character . fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects . this , in turn , makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world . the central processing part , on the other hand , takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.although fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal , externally determined aspect , in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents . his contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism . fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind . he argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics , for example , can not be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses . he also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded darwinian and neo-darwinian theories of natural selection .

a brand is a name , term , design , symbol or any other feature that identifies one seller 's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers . brands are used in business , marketing , and advertising for recognition and , importantly , to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified , to the benefit of the brand 's customers , its owners and shareholders . name brands are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands.the practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient egyptians , who were known to have engaged in livestock branding as early as 2,700 bce . branding was used to differentiate one person 's cattle from another 's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal 's skin with a hot branding iron . if a person stole any of the cattle , anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner . the term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company , so that `` brand '' now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into . over time the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil , wine , cosmetics , and fish sauce and , in the 21st century , extends even further into services ( such as legal , financial and medical ) , political parties and people ( e.g . lady gaga and katy perry ) . branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice.in the modern era , the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the marketing and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a company or products from competitors , aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of customers . the key components that form a brand 's toolbox include a brand 's identity , personality , product design , brand communication ( such as by logos and trademarks ) , brand awareness , brand loyalty , and various branding ( brand management ) strategies . many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century , hence branding is among a few remaining forms of product differentiation.brand equity is the measurable totality of a brand 's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components . as markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating , brand equity is built by the deployment of marketing techniques to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty , with side effects like reduced price sensitivity . a brand is , in essence , a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits . when a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors , a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity . special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity . in accounting , a brand defined as an intangible asset , is often the most valuable asset on a corporation 's balance sheet . brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value . brand valuation is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand , and allows marketing investment to be managed ( e.g . : prioritized across a portfolio of brands ) to maximize shareholder value . although only acquired brands appear on a company 's balance sheet , the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.the word ‘brand’ is often used as a metonym referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand . marque or make are often used to denote a brand of motor vehicle , which may be distinguished from a car model . a `` concept brand '' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept , like breast cancer awareness or environmentalism , rather than a specific product , service , or business . a `` commodity brand '' is a brand associated with a commodity . 
the western front was the main theatre of war during the first world war . following the outbreak of war in august 1914 , the german army opened the western front by invading luxembourg and belgium , then gaining military control of important industrial regions in france . the tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the battle of the marne . following the race to the sea , both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches , stretching from the north sea to the swiss frontier with france , which changed little except during early 1917 and in 1918.between 1915 and 1917 there were several offensives along this front . the attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances . entrenchments , machine gun emplacements , barbed wire and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties during attacks and counter-attacks and no significant advances were made . among the most costly of these offensives were the battle of verdun , in 1916 , with a combined 700,000 casualties ( estimated ) , the battle of the somme , also in 1916 , with more than a million casualties ( estimated ) , and the battle of passchendaele ( third battle of ypres ) , in 1917 , with 487,000 casualties ( estimated ) .to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the western front , both sides tried new military technology , including poison gas , aircraft , and tanks . the adoption of better tactics and the cumulative weakening of the armies in the west led to the return of mobility in 1918 . the german spring offensive of 1918 was made possible by the treaty of brest-litovsk that ended the war of the central powers against russia and romania on the eastern front . using short , intense `` hurricane '' bombardments and infiltration tactics , the german armies moved nearly to the west , the deepest advance by either side since 1914 , but the result was indecisive.the unstoppable advance of the allied armies during the hundred days offensive of 1918 caused a sudden collapse of the german armies and persuaded the german commanders that defeat was inevitable . the german government surrendered in the armistice of 11 november 1918 , and the terms of peace were settled by the treaty of versailles in 1919 .

mudrocks are a class of fine grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks . the varying types of mudrocks include : `` siltstone '' , `` claystone '' , `` mudstone '' , `` slate '' , and `` shale '' . most of the particles of which the stone is composed are less than 0.0625 mm ( 1/16th mm or 0.0025 inches ) and are too small to study readily in the field . at first sight the rock types look quite similar ; however , there are important differences in composition and nomenclature . there has been a great deal of disagreement involving the classification of mudrocks . there are a few important hurdles to classification , including : mudrocks make up fifty percent of the sedimentary rocks in the geologic record , and are easily the most widespread deposits on earth . fine sediment is the most abundant product of erosion , and these sediments contribute to the overall omnipresence of mudrocks . with increased pressure over time the platey clay minerals may become aligned , with the appearance of parallel layering ( fissility ) . this finely bedded material that splits readily into thin layers is called `` shale '' , as distinct from `` mudstone '' . the lack of fissility or layering in mudstone may be due either to the original texture or to the disruption of layering by burrowing organisms in the sediment prior to lithification.from the beginning of civilization , when pottery and mudbricks were made by hand , to now , mudrocks have been important . the first book on mudrocks , `` geologie des argils '' by millot , was not published until 1964 ; however , scientists , engineers , and oil producers have understood the significance of mudrocks since the discovery of the burgess shale and the relatedness of mudrocks and oil . literature on this omnipresent rock-type has been increasing in recent years , and technology continues to allow for better analysis .

the battle of reading was a victory for a danish viking army over a west saxon force on about 4 january 871 at reading in berkshire . the vikings were led by bagsecg and halfdan ragnarsson and the west saxons by king æthelred and his brother , the future king alfred the great . it was the second of a series of battles that took place following an invasion of wessex by the danish army in december 870.by 870 , the vikings had conquered two of the four anglo-saxon kingdoms , northumbria and east anglia . at the end of 870 they launched an attempt to conquer wessex and marched from east anglia to reading , arriving on about 28 december . the town was between the thames and kennet rivers and they set about building a ditch and rampart on the southern side between the two rivers . three days after their arrival they sent out a large foraging party , which was defeated by an army of local levies under the command of æthelwulf , ealdorman of berkshire , at the battle of englefield.after another four days , on about 4 january 871 , æthelred and alfred brought up the main west saxon army and joined æthelwulf 's forces for an attack on the danes . the west saxons fought their way to the town , slaughtering all the danes they found outside , but when they reached the town gate the vikings burst out and defeated the west saxons with a successful counter-attack . among the dead was æthelwulf , whose body was secretly carried off to be buried in his native derby . according to a late source , æthelred and alfred only escaped due their better knowledge of the local terrain , which allowed them to lose their pursuers by fording the river loddon.their surviving forces regrouped at windsor and four days later æthelred and alfred were victorious at the battle of ashdown , but they were then defeated again at the battles of basing and meretun . soon after easter , which fell on 15 april in that year , æthelred died and was succeeded by alfred.the battle of reading can be dated because bishop heahmund of sherborne died in the battle of meretun , and it is known that he died on 22 march 871 . the `` anglo-saxon chronicle '' records that the battle of basing was two months earlier , dating it to 22 january , ashdown fourteen days before that on 8 january , reading four days earlier on 4 january , englefield another four days earlier on 31 december 870 and the arrival of the vikings in reading three days earlier on 28 december . however , as the two month interval between meretun and basing is probably not exact , the earlier dates are approximate .

according to latter day saint belief , the golden plates ( also called the gold plates or in some 19th-century literature , the golden bible ) are the source from which joseph smith translated the book of mormon , a sacred text of the faith . some witnesses described the plates as weighing from , golden in color , and composed of thin metallic pages engraved with hieroglyphics on both sides and bound with three d-shaped rings.smith said that he found the plates on september 22 , 1823 , on a hill near his home in manchester , new york , after the angel moroni directed him to a buried stone box . he said that the angel prevented him from taking the plates but instructed him to return to the same location in a year . he returned to that site every year , but it was not until september 1827 that he recovered the plates on his fourth annual attempt to retrieve them . he returned home with a heavy object wrapped in a frock , which he then put in a box . he allowed others to heft the box but said that the angel had forbidden him to show the plates to anyone until they had been translated from their original `` reformed egyptian '' language.smith dictated the text of the plates while a scribe wrote down the words which would later become the book of mormon . eyewitnesses to the process said smith translated the plates , not by looking directly at them , but by looking through a transparent seer stone in the bottom of his hat , similar to modern-day glasses . smith published the first edition of the translation in march of 1830 as the book of mormon , with a print run of 5,000 copies at a production cost of $ 3,000 ( or 60 cents per book ) .smith eventually obtained testimonies from 11 men who said that they had seen the plates , known as the book of mormon witnesses . after the translation was complete , smith said that he returned the plates to the angel moroni ; thus they could never be examined . latter day saints believe the account of the golden plates as a matter of faith , and critics often assert that either smith manufactured them himself or that the book of mormon witnesses based their testimony on visions rather than physical experience .

the history of indonesia has been shaped by its geographic position , its natural resources , a series of human migrations and contacts , wars and conquests , as well as by trade , economics and politics . indonesia is an archipelagic country of 17,000 to 18,000 islands ( 8,844 named and 922 permanently inhabited ) stretching along the equator in south east asia . the country 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade ; trade has since fundamentally shaped indonesian history . the area of indonesia is populated by peoples of various migrations , creating a diversity of cultures , ethnicities , and languages . the archipelago 's landforms and climate significantly influenced agriculture and trade , and the formation of states . the boundaries of the state of indonesia represent the 20th century borders of the dutch east indies.fossilised remains of `` homo erectus '' and his tools , popularly known as the `` java man '' , suggest the indonesian archipelago was inhabited by at least 1.5 million years ago . austronesian people , who form the majority of the modern population , are thought to have originally been from taiwan and arrived in indonesia around 2000 bce . from the 7th century ce , the powerful srivijaya naval kingdom flourished bringing hindu and buddhist influences with it . the agricultural buddhist sailendra and hindu mataram dynasties subsequently thrived and declined in inland java . the last significant non-muslim kingdom , the hindu majapahit kingdom , flourished from the late 13th century , and its influence stretched over much of indonesia . the earliest evidence of islamised populations in indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern sumatra ; other indonesian areas gradually adopted islam which became the dominant religion in java and sumatra by the end of the 16th century . for the most part , islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences.europeans such as the portuguese arrived in indonesia from the 16th century seeking to monopolise the sources of valuable nutmeg , cloves , and cubeb pepper in maluku . in 1602 the dutch established the dutch east india company ( voc ) and became the dominant european power by 1610 . following bankruptcy , the voc was formally dissolved in 1800 , and the government of the netherlands established the dutch east indies under government control . by the early 20th century , dutch dominance extended to the current boundaries . the japanese invasion and subsequent occupation in 1942–45 during wwii ended dutch rule , and encouraged the previously suppressed indonesian independence movement . two days after the surrender of japan in august 1945 , nationalist leader , sukarno , declared independence and became president . the netherlands tried to reestablish its rule , but a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in december 1949 , when in the face of international pressure , the dutch formally recognised indonesian independence.an attempted coup in 1965 led to a violent army-led anti-communist purge in which over half a million people were killed . general suharto politically outmanoeuvred president sukarno , and became president in march 1968 . his new order administration garnered the favour of the west , whose investment in indonesia was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth . in the late 1990s , however , indonesia was the country hardest hit by the east asian financial crisis , which led to popular protests and suharto 's resignation on 21 may 1998 . the `` reformasi '' era following suharto 's resignation , has led to a strengthening of democratic processes , including a regional autonomy program , the secession of east timor , and the first direct presidential election in 2004 . political and economic instability , social unrest , corruption , natural disasters , and terrorism have slowed progress . although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problems in some areas .

the 1944 united states presidential election was the 40th quadrennial presidential election . it was held on tuesday , november 7 , 1944 . the election took place during world war ii . incumbent democratic president franklin d. roosevelt defeated republican thomas e. dewey to win an unprecedented fourth term . until 1996 , this would be the last time in which an incumbent democratic president would win reelection after serving a full term in office.roosevelt had become the first president to win a third term with his victory in the 1940 presidential election , and there was little doubt that he would seek a fourth term . unlike in 1940 , roosevelt faced little opposition within his own party , and he easily won the presidential nomination of the 1944 democratic national convention . concerned that roosevelt 's ill-health would mean the vice president would likely become president , the convention dropped roosevelt 's running mate henry a. wallace in favor of senator harry s. truman of missouri . governor dewey of new york emerged as the front-runner for the republican nomination after his victory in the wisconsin primary , and he defeated conservative governor john w. bricker at the 1944 republican national convention.as world war ii was going well for the united states and its allies , roosevelt remained popular despite his long tenure . dewey campaigned against the new deal and for a smaller government , but was ultimately unsuccessful in convincing the country to change course . the election was closer than roosevelt 's other presidential campaigns , but roosevelt still won by a comfortable margin in the popular vote and by a wide margin in the electoral college . rumors of roosevelt 's ill health , though somewhat dispelled by his vigorous campaigning , proved to be prescient ; roosevelt died less than three months into his fourth term and was succeeded by truman .

calvinism ( also called the reformed tradition , reformed christianity , reformed protestantism , or the reformed faith ) is a major branch of protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of christian practice set down by john calvin and other reformation-era theologians.calvinists broke from the roman catholic church in the 16th century . calvinists differ from lutherans ( another major branch of the reformation ) on the real presence of christ in the eucharist , theories of worship , and the use of god 's law for believers , among other things . the term `` calvinism '' can be misleading , because the religious tradition which it denotes has always been diverse , with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder ; however almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of augustine of hippo a millennium prior . in the context of the reformation , huldrych zwingli began the reformed tradition in 1519 in the city of zürich . his followers were instantly labeled `` zwinglians '' , consistent with the catholic practice of naming heresy after its founder . very soon , zwingli was joined by martin bucer , wolfgang capito , william farel , johannes oecolampadius and other early reformed thinkers.the namesake of the movement , french reformer john calvin , renounced roman catholicism and embraced protestant views in the late 1520s or early 1530s , as the earliest notions of later reformed tradition were already espoused by huldrych zwingli . the movement was first called `` calvinism '' , referring to john calvin , by lutherans who opposed it . many within the tradition find it either an indescriptive or an inappropriate term and would prefer the word `` reformed '' to be used instead . the most important reformed theologians include calvin , zwingli , martin bucer , william farel , heinrich bullinger , peter martyr vermigli , theodore beza , and john knox . in the twentieth century , abraham kuyper , herman bavinck , b . b. warfield , j. gresham machen , karl barth , martyn lloyd-jones , cornelius van til , gordon clark , and r. c. sproul were influential . contemporary reformed theologians include j. i. packer , john macarthur , timothy j. keller , david wells , and michael horton.the reformed tradition is largely represented by the continental reformed , presbyterian , evangelical anglican , congregationalist , and reformed baptist denominational families . several forms of ecclesiastical polity are exercised by a group of reformed churches , including presbyterian , congregationalist , and some episcopalian . the biggest reformed association is the world communion of reformed churches with more than 100 million members in 211 member denominations around the world . there are more conservative reformed federations such as the world reformed fellowship and the international conference of reformed churches , as well as independent churches .

the golan heights ( or , ) , or simply the golan , is a region in the levant , spanning about . the region defined as the golan heights differs between disciplines : as a geological and biogeographical region , the golan heights is a basaltic plateau bordered by the yarmouk river in the south , the sea of galilee and hula valley in the west , the anti-lebanon with mount hermon in the north and wadi raqqad in the east . as a geopolitical region , the golan heights is the area captured from syria and occupied by israel during the 1967 six-day war , territory which has been administered as part of israel since 1981 . this region includes the western two-thirds of the geological golan heights and the israeli-occupied part of mount hermon.the earliest evidence of human habitation on the golan dates to the upper paleolithic period . according to the bible , an amorite kingdom in bashan was conquered by israelites during the reign of king og . throughout the biblical period , the golan was `` the focus of a power struggle between the kings of israel and the aramaeans who were based near modern-day damascus . '' after assyrian and babylonian rule , persia dominated the region and allowed it to be resettled by returning jews from the babylonian captivity . the itureans , an arab or aramaic people , settled there in the 2nd century bce and remained until the end of the byzantine period . gamla , the capital of jewish galaunitis , would play a major role in the jewish-roman wars , and came to house the earliest known urban synagogue from the hasmonean/herodian realm . organized jewish settlement in the region came to an end in 636 ce when it was conquered by arabs under umar ibn al-khattāb . in the 16th century , the golan was conquered by the ottoman empire and was part of the vilayet of damascus until it was transferred to french mandate in 1918 . when the mandate terminated in 1946 , it became part of the newly independent syrian republic.since the 1967 six-day war , the western two-thirds of the golan heights has been occupied and administered by israel , whereas the eastern third remains under control of the syrian arab republic . following the war , syria dismissed any negotiations with israel as part of the khartoum resolution . construction of israeli settlements began in the remainder of the territory held by israel , which was under military administration until the knesset passed the golan heights law in 1981 , which applied israeli law to the territory ; a move that has been described as an annexation . this move was condemned by the united nations security council in resolution 497 , which stated that `` the israeli decision to impose its laws , jurisdiction , and administration in the occupied syrian golan heights is null and void and without international legal effect '' , and resolution 242 , which emphasises `` inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war '' . israel maintains it has a right to retain the golan , also citing the text of un resolution 242 , which calls for `` safe and recognised boundaries free from threats or acts of force '' .after the onset of the syrian civil war , control of the syrian-administered part of the golan heights was split between the government and opposition forces , with the undof maintaining a buffer zone in between , to implement the ceasefire of the purple line . from 2012 to 2018 , the eastern golan heights became a scene of repeated battles between the syrian arab army , rebel factions of the syrian opposition including the moderate southern front , jihadist al-nusra front , and isil-affiliated factions . in july 2018 , the syrian government regained control of the eastern golan heights.on 25 march 2019 , u.s. president donald trump proclaimed that `` the united states recognizes that the golan heights are part of the state of israel '' , making the united states the first country besides israel to recognize israeli sovereignty over the golan heights . the 28 member states of the european union declared in turn they do not recognize israeli sovereignty , and several israeli experts on international law stated the principle remains that land gained by defensive or offensive wars can not be legally annexed under international law .

caesium ( iupac spelling ) ( also spelled cesium in american english ) is a chemical element with the symbol cs and atomic number 55 . it is a soft , silvery-golden alkali metal with a melting point of , which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature . caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium . the most reactive of all metals , it is pyrophoric and reacts with water even at . it is the least electronegative element , with a value of 0.79 on the pauling scale . it has only one stable isotope , caesium-133 . caesium is mined mostly from pollucite , while the radioisotopes , especially caesium-137 , a fission product , are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.the german chemist robert bunsen and physicist gustav kirchhoff discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy . the first small-scale applications for caesium were as a `` getter '' in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells . in 1967 , acting on einstein 's proof that the speed of light is the most constant dimension in the universe , the international system of units used two specific wave counts from an emission spectrum of caesium-133 to co-define the second and the metre . since then , caesium has been widely used in highly accurate atomic clocks.since the 1990s , the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids , but it has a range of applications in the production of electricity , in electronics , and in chemistry . the radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years and is used in medical applications , industrial gauges , and hydrology . nonradioactive caesium compounds are only mildly toxic , but the pure metal 's tendency to react explosively with water means that caesium is considered a hazardous material , and the radioisotopes present a significant health and ecological hazard in the environment .

cremation is a method of final disposition of a dead body through burning ( combustion ) .cremation may serve as a funeral or post-funeral rite and as an alternative to the burial or interment of an intact dead body . in some countries , including india and nepal , cremation on an open-air pyre is an ancient tradition . starting in the 19th century , cremation was introduced or reintroduced into other parts of the world . in modern times , cremation is commonly carried out with a closed furnace ( cremator ) , at a crematorium.cremation leaves behind an average of 2.4 kg ( 5.3 lbs ) of remains , known as `` ashes '' or `` cremains '' . this is not actual ash but unburnt fragments of bone mineral , which are commonly ground down into powder . they do not constitute a health risk and may be buried , interred in a memorial site , retained by relatives or scattered in various ways . 
intermolecular forces ( imf ) are the forces which mediate interaction between molecules , including forces of attraction or repulsion which act between molecules and other types of neighboring particles , e.g . atoms or ions . intermolecular forces are weak relative to intramolecular forces – the forces which hold a molecule together . for example , the covalent bond , involving sharing electron pairs between atoms , is much stronger than the forces present between neighboring molecules . both sets of forces are essential parts of force fields frequently used in molecular mechanics.the investigation of intermolecular forces starts from macroscopic observations which indicate the existence and action of forces at a molecular level . these observations include non-ideal-gas thermodynamic behavior reflected by virial coefficients , vapor pressure , viscosity , superficial tension , and absorption data.the first reference to the nature of microscopic forces is found in alexis clairaut 's work `` theorie de la figure de la terre '' . other scientists who have contributed to the investigation of microscopic forces include : laplace , gauss , maxwell and boltzmann.attractive intermolecular forces are categorized into the following types : information on intermolecular forces is obtained by macroscopic measurements of properties like viscosity , pressure , volume , temperature ( pvt ) data . the link to microscopic aspects is given by virial coefficients and lennard-jones potentials .

socrates ( ; `` sōkrátēs '' ; – 399 bc ) was a greek philosopher from athens who is credited as one of the founders of western philosophy , and as being the first moral philosopher of the western ethical tradition of thought.an enigmatic figure , he made no writings , and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime , particularly his students plato and xenophon . other sources include the contemporaneous antisthenes , aristippus , and aeschines of sphettos . aristophanes , a playwright , is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning socrates during socrates ' lifetime , though a fragment of ion of chios ' `` travel journal '' provides important information about socrates ' youth.plato 's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of socrates to survive from antiquity , from which socrates has become renowned for his contributions to the fields of ethics and epistemology . it is this who lends his name to the concepts of socratic irony and the socratic method , or `` elenchus . '' however , questions remain regarding the distinction between the real-life socrates and plato 's portrayal of socrates in his dialogues.socrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and in the modern era . depictions of socrates in art , literature and popular culture have made him one of the most widely known figures in the western philosophical tradition .

copy editing ( also copyediting ) is the process of revising written material to improve readability and fitness for its purpose , as well as ensuring that text is free of grammatical and factual errors . in the context of publication in print , copy editing is done before typesetting and again before proofreading , the final step in the editorial cycle . `` the chicago manual of style '' prefers the term `` manuscript editing '' '' . `` as described by `` chicago , '' `` manuscript editing encompasses any or all of the tasks along a continuum from simple mechanical corrections ( mechanical editing ) through sentence-level interventions ( line , or stylistic , editing ) to substantial remedial work on literary style and clarity , disorganized passages , baggy prose , muddled tables and figures , and the like ( substantive editing ) . several professional associations of editors further describe this continuum of manuscript editing in terms of levels of editing and characterize the degrees of intervention as light , medium , and heavy copy editing . `` in the world beyond traditional book and journal publishing , the term copy editing is sometimes applied to an even more expansive range of tasks , or the work is incorrectly referred to as proofreading by authors despite their lofty expectations of the services to be provided . besides performing the conventional copy editing duties , an editor in these nontraditional publishing environments may be expected to assess the suitability of a manuscript for publication ( usually the role of an acquisitions editor or literary agent ) ; to review content , evaluate and reshape a manuscript , or overhaul organization and literary style ( the work of a development or substantive editor ) .although copy editors are generally expected to make simple revisions to smooth awkward passages , they do not have a license to rewrite a text line by line , nor do they prepare material on an author 's behalf . creating original content to be published under another person 's name is called `` ghostwriting '' . furthermore , copy editors are expected to query structural and organizational problems , but they are not expected to fix these problems . helping an author develop an idea into a publishable manuscript , overhauling a rough draft , identifying gaps in subject coverage , devising strategies for more effective communication of content , and creating features to enhance the final product and make it more competitive in the marketplace—these tasks describe `` developmental editing '' .in the united states and canada , an editor who does this work is called a `` copy editor '' . an organization 's highest-ranking copy editor , or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors , may be known as the `` copy chief '' , `` copy desk chief '' , or `` news editor '' . in book publishing in the united kingdom and other parts of the world that follow british nomenclature , the term `` copy editor '' is used , but in newspaper and magazine publishing , the term is subeditor ( or sub-editor ) , commonly shortened to `` sub '' . the senior subeditor of a publication is often called the `` chief subeditor '' . as the prefix `` sub '' suggests , copy editors typically have less authority than regular editors.in the context of the internet , online copy refers to the textual content of web pages . similar to print , online copy editing is the process of revising and preparing the raw or draft text of web pages for publication.copy editing has three levels : light , medium , and heavy . depending on the budget and scheduling of the publication , the publisher will let the copy editor know what level of editing to employ . the chosen type of editing will help the copy editor prioritize their efforts.within copy editing , there is mechanical editing and substantive editing : mechanical editing is the process of aligning a document with editorial or house style , keeping the preferred style and grammar rules of publication consistent across all content . it refers to editing in terms of spelling , punctuation , and correct usage of grammatical symbols , along with reviewing special elements such as tables , charts , formatting footnotes , and endnotes . content editing , also known as substantive editing , is the editing of the material , including its structure and organization , to ensure internal consistency . content editing may require heavy editing or rewriting as compared to mechanical editing.in addition , copy editing may change punctuation , spelling , and usage for a different country . for a commonwealth readership , the oxford british and american spelling of `` organize '' may be changed to `` organise '' , and `` color '' changed to `` colour '' .

in physics , a standing wave , also known as a stationary wave , is a wave which oscillates in time but whose peak amplitude profile does not move in space . the peak amplitude of the wave oscillations at any point in space is constant with time , and the oscillations at different points throughout the wave are in phase . the locations at which the absolute value of the amplitude is minimum are called nodes , and the locations where the absolute value of the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes.standing waves were first noticed by michael faraday in 1831 . faraday observed standing waves on the surface of a liquid in a vibrating container . franz melde coined the term `` standing wave '' ( german : `` stehende welle '' or `` stehwelle '' ) around 1860 and demonstrated the phenomenon in his classic experiment with vibrating strings.this phenomenon can occur because the medium is moving in the opposite direction to the wave , or it can arise in a stationary medium as a result of interference between two waves traveling in opposite directions . the most common cause of standing waves is the phenomenon of resonance , in which standing waves occur inside a resonator due to interference between waves reflected back and forth at the resonator 's resonant frequency.for waves of equal amplitude traveling in opposing directions , there is on average no net propagation of energy .

in organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry , nucleophilic substitution is a fundamental class of reactions in which a leaving group ( nucleophile ) is replaced by an electron rich compound ( electrophile ) . the whole molecular entity of which the electrophile and the leaving group are part is usually called the substrate . the nucleophile essentially attempts to replace the leaving group as the primary substituent in the reaction itself , as a part of another molecule.the most general form of the reaction may be given as the following : the electron pair ( : ) from the nucleophile ( nuc ) attacks the substrate ( r-lg ) forming a new bond , while the leaving group ( lg ) departs with an electron pair . the principal product in this case is r-nuc . the nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged , whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged.an example of nucleophilic substitution is the hydrolysis of an alkyl bromide , r-br , under basic conditions , where the `` attacking '' nucleophile is the oh and the leaving group is br.nucleophilic substitution reactions are commonplace in organic chemistry , and they can be broadly categorised as taking place at a saturated aliphatic carbon or at ( less often ) an aromatic or other unsaturated carbon centre .

the austro-hungarian compromise of 1867 ( , ) established the dual monarchy of austria-hungary . the compromise put an end to the 18-year-long military dictatorship and absolutist rule over hungary , which was introduced by francis joseph after the hungarian revolution of 1848 . the compromise partially re-established the former sovereignty of the kingdom of hungary , however being separate from , but no longer subject to the austrian empire . the agreement also restored the old historic constitution of the kingdom of hungary.the hungarian political leaders had two main goals during the negotiations . one was to regain the traditional status ( both legal and political ) of the hungarian state , which was lost after the hungarian revolution of 1848 . the other was to restore the series of reform laws of the revolutionary parliament of 1848 , which were based on the 12 points that established modern civil and political rights , economic and societal reforms in hungary . even the april laws of the hungarian revolutionary parliament ( with the exception of the laws based on the 9th and 10th points ) were restored by francis joseph.under the compromise , the lands of the house of habsburg were reorganized as a real union between the austrian empire and the kingdom of hungary , headed by a single monarch who reigned as emperor of austria in the austrian half of the empire , and as king of hungary in kingdom of hungary . the cisleithanian ( austrian ) and transleithanian ( hungarian ) states were governed by separate parliaments and prime ministers . the two countries conducted unified foreign diplomatic and defense policies . for these purposes , `` common '' ministries of foreign affairs and defence were maintained under the monarch 's direct authority , as was a third ministry responsible only for financing the two `` common '' portfolios.the compromise remained bitterly unpopular among the ethnic hungarian voters , because ethnic hungarians did not vote for the ruling pro-compromise parties in the hungarian parliamentary elections . therefore the political maintenance of the austro-hungarian compromise ( thus austria-hungary itself ) was mostly a result of the popularity of pro-compromise ruling liberal party among the ethnic minority voters in kingdom of hungary.according to emperor franz joseph i of austria , `` there were three of us who made the agreement : deák , andrássy and myself .

uniform numbers in american football are unusual compared to those in other sports . they are displayed in more locations on the uniform ; they are universally worn on both the front and back of the jersey ; and in many cases `` tv numbers '' are displayed on either the jersey sleeves , the shoulder pad , or occasionally on the helmets . the numbers on the front and back of the jersey also are very large , covering most of the jersey . more importantly , certain numbers may only be worn by players playing specific positions ; thus , the jersey numbers assist the officials in determining possible rules infractions by players.under current rules in all three of the most prominent levels of american football ( high school football , college football and professional football ) , all players must wear a number from 1 to 99 , and no two players on the same team may wear the same number on the field at the same time . players could formerly use the numbers 0 and 00 , numbers that were phased out in the 1970s , and on two special occasions in the 1960s , placekickers wore the number 100 . use of the number 0 will again be allowed by the ncaa in american college football , starting with the 2020 season.players who wear numbers from 50 to 79 are , by rule , prohibited from catching or touching forward passes if their team is in possession of the ball and may not line up in a position that allows them to do so , unless explicitly indicated to the referee during a tackle-eligible play . other than this , the correspondence between jersey numbers and player positions is largely a matter of style , tradition and semantics.the related sport of canadian football follows a similar numbering scheme to that of american scholastic football , except that the ineligible numbers span only from 50 to 69 ( historically , it was 40 to 69 ) and numbers 0 and 00 are available for use .

a pidgin , or pidgin language , is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common : typically , its vocabulary and grammar are limited and often drawn from several languages . it is most commonly employed in situations such as trade , or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside ( but where there is no common language between the groups ) .fundamentally , a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication , as it is constructed impromptu , or by convention , between individuals or groups of people . a pidgin is not the native language of any speech community , but is instead learned as a second language.a pidgin may be built from words , sounds , or body language from a multitude of languages as well as onomatopoeia . as the lexicon of any pidgin will be limited to core vocabulary , words with only a specific meaning in lexifier language may acquire a completely new ( or additional ) meaning in the pidgin.pidgins have historically been considered a form of `` patois '' , unsophisticated simplified versions of their lexifiers , and as such usually have low prestige with respect to other languages . however , not all simplified or `` unsophisticated '' forms of a language are pidgins . each pidgin has its own norms of usage which must be learned for proficiency in the pidgin.a pidgin differs from a creole , which is the first language of a speech community of native speakers that at one point arose from a pidgin . unlike pidgins , creoles have fully developed vocabulary and patterned grammar . most linguists believe that a creole develops through a process of nativization of a pidgin when children of acquired pidgin-speakers learn and use it as their native language .

susan lillian townsend , frsl ( née johnstone , 2 april 194610 april 2014 ) , was an english writer and humorist whose work encompasses novels , plays and works of journalism . she was best known for creating the character adrian mole.after writing in secret from the age of 14 , townsend first became known for her plays , her signature character first appearing in a radio drama , but her work soon expanded into other forms . she enjoyed great success in the 1980s , with her adrian mole books selling more copies than any other work of fiction in britain during the decade . this series , which eventually encompassed nine books , takes the form of the character 's diaries . the earliest books recount the life of a teenage boy during the thatcher years , but the sequence eventually depicts adrian mole in middle age . `` the queen and i '' ( 1992 ) , another popular work which was well received , was an outlet for her republican sentiments , although the royal family is still rendered with sympathy . both the earliest adrian mole book and `` the queen and i '' were adapted for the stage and enjoyed successful runs in london 's west end.townsend was poor until well into her thirties , and used her experiences of hardship in her work . in her later years she suffered ill health , in part related to the diabetes she developed in the mid-1980s , and in her last years endured serious sight and mobility problems . 
the eastern theater of the american civil war consists of the major military and naval operations in the states of virginia , west virginia , maryland , and pennsylvania , the district of columbia , and the coastal fortifications and seaports of north carolina . ( operations in the interior of the carolinas in 1865 are considered part of the western theater , while the other coastal areas along the atlantic ocean are included in the lower seaboard theater . ) the eastern theater was the venue for several major campaigns launched by the union army of the potomac to capture the confederate capital of richmond , virginia ; many of these were frustrated by the confederate army of northern virginia , commanded by general robert e. lee . president abraham lincoln sought a general to match lee 's boldness , appointing in turn maj. gens . irvin mcdowell , george b. mcclellan , john pope , ambrose burnside , joseph hooker , and george g. meade to command his principal eastern armies . while meade gained a decisive victory over lee at the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 , it was not until newly appointed general-in-chief ulysses s. grant arrived from the western theater in 1864 to take personal control of operations in virginia that union forces were able to capture richmond , but only after several bloody battles of the overland campaign and a nine-month siege near the cities of petersburg and richmond . the surrender of lee 's army at appomattox court house in april 1865 brought major operations in the area to a close.while many of the campaigns and battles were fought in the region of virginia between washington , d.c. , and richmond , there were other major campaigns fought nearby . the western virginia campaign of 1861 secured union control over the western counties of virginia , which would be formed into the new state of west virginia . confederate coastal areas and ports were seized in southeastern virginia and north carolina . the shenandoah valley was marked by frequent clashes in 1862 , 1863 , and 1864 . lee launched two unsuccessful invasions of union territory in hopes of influencing northern opinion to end the war . in the fall of 1862 , lee followed his successful northern virginia campaign with his first invasion , the maryland campaign , which culminated in his strategic defeat in the battle of antietam . in the summer of 1863 , lee 's second invasion , the gettysburg campaign , reached into pennsylvania , farther north than any other major confederate army . following a confederate attack on washington , d.c. , itself in 1864 , union forces commanded by philip h. sheridan launched a campaign in the shenandoah valley , which cost the confederacy control over a major food supply for lee 's army .

guthrum ( , died c. 890 ) was king of the east angles . he was one of the leaders of the 'great summer army ' that arrived in reading during april 871 , to join forces with the great danish army . the danish army 's intention was to conquer the kingdoms that were anglo-saxon england . they conquered the kingdoms of east anglia , mercia , and northumbria , as well as overunning alfred the great 's wessex . however alfred was able to defeat them at the battle of edington ( 878 ) . the danes retreated to their stronghold , where alfred laid siege and eventually guthrum surrendered . under the terms of his surrender guthrum was obliged to be baptised and leave wessex . there followed the treaty of alfred and guthrum that sets out the boundaries between alfred and guthrum 's territories as well as agreements on peaceful trade , and the `` weregild '' value of its people . this treaty is seen as the basis of the foundation of danelaw . guthrum ruled east anglia under his baptismal name of æthelstan , until his death . 
damon albarn ( ; born 23 march 1968 ) is an english musician , singer , songwriter , and record producer , best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band blur and as the co-founder , lead vocalist , instrumentalist , and primary songwriter of the virtual band gorillaz.raised in leytonstone , east london , and around colchester , essex , albarn attended the stanway school , where he met guitarist graham coxon and formed blur , releasing their debut album `` leisure '' in 1991 . after spending long periods touring the u.s. , albarn 's songwriting became increasingly influenced by british bands from the 1960s . the result was the blur albums `` modern life is rubbish '' ( 1993 ) , `` parklife '' ( 1994 ) and `` the great escape '' ( 1995 ) . all three albums received critical acclaim while blur gained mass popularity in the uk , aided by a britpop rivalry with oasis . subsequent albums such as `` blur '' ( 1997 ) , `` 13 '' ( 1999 ) , and `` think tank '' ( 2003 ) incorporated influences from lo-fi , electronic and hip hop music.albarn formed the virtual band gorillaz in 1998 with comic book artist jamie hewlett . drawing influences from hip hop , dub , pop , trip hop , and world music , gorillaz released their self-titled debut album in 2001 to worldwide success , spawning successful follow-ups `` demon days '' ( 2005 ) , `` plastic beach '' , `` the fall '' ( both released in 2010 ) , `` humanz '' ( 2017 ) , and `` the now now '' ( 2018 ) . although albarn is the only permanent musical contributor , gorillaz albums typically feature collaborations from a range of artists . gorillaz are cited by the `` guinness book of world records '' as the `` most successful virtual band '' .albarn 's other notable projects have included two supergroups : the good , the bad & the queen and rocket juice & the moon , working with the non-profit organization africa express , which he co-founded , and composing film soundtracks . he also scored the stage productions `` '' ( 2008 ) , `` dr dee '' ( 2012 ) and `` wonder.land '' ( 2016 ) . his debut , and thus far only , solo studio album `` everyday robots '' was released in 2014.in 2008 , `` the daily telegraph '' ranked albarn number 18 in their list of the `` 100 most powerful people in british culture '' . in 2016 , albarn received the ivor novello award for lifetime achievement from the british academy of songwriters , composers and authors . he was appointed officer of the order of the british empire ( obe ) in the 2016 new year honours for services to music . 
a regiment is a military unit . their role and size varies markedly , depending on the country and the arm of service.in medieval europe , the term `` regiment '' denoted any large body of front-line soldiers , recruited or conscripted in one geographical area , by a leader who was often also the feudal lord of the soldiers.by the end of the 17th century , regiments in most european armies were permanent units , numbering about 1,000 men and under the command of a colonel . 
ngc 3521 is a flocculent intermediate spiral galaxy located around 26 million light-years away from earth in the constellation leo . it has a morphological classification of sab ( rs ) bc , which indicates that it is a spiral galaxy with a trace of a bar structure ( sab ) , a weak inner ring ( rs ) , and moderate to loosely wound arm structure ( bc ) . the bar structure is difficult to discern , both because it has a low ellipticity and the galaxy is at a high inclination of 72.7° to the line of sight . the relatively bright bulge is nearly 3/4 the size of the bar , which may indicate the former is quite massive . the nucleus of this galaxy is classified as an hii liner , as there is an h ii region at the core and the nucleus forms a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region . 
tartu ( , south estonian : `` tarto '' ) is the second largest city of estonia , after estonia 's political and financial capital tallinn . situated southeast of tallinn and 245 kilometres ( 152 miles ) northeast of riga , the capital of latvia . the distance to estonia 's summer holiday capital pärnu in the west is and the fastest route there by car is through viljandi and kilingi-nõmme . tartu lies on the emajõgi ( `` mother river '' ) , which connects the two largest lakes of estonia , lake võrtsjärv and lake peipus . the city is served by tartu airport.tartu is often considered the intellectual centre of the country , especially since it is home to the nation 's oldest and most renowned university , the university of tartu ; tartu itself is also the oldest city of estonia and other baltic countries . tartu houses the supreme court of estonia , the ministry of education and research , the estonian national museum , and the oldest estonian-language theater , vanemuine . it is also the birthplace of the estonian song festivals . 
the density ( more precisely , the volumetric mass density ; also known as specific mass ) , of a substance is its mass per unit volume . the symbol most often used for density is `` ρ '' ( the lower case greek letter rho ) , although the latin letter `` d '' can also be used . mathematically , density is defined as mass divided by volume : where `` ρ '' is the density , `` m '' is the mass , and `` v '' is the volume . in some cases ( for instance , in the united states oil and gas industry ) , density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume , although this is scientifically inaccurate – this quantity is more specifically called specific weight.for a pure substance the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration.different materials usually have different densities , and density may be relevant to buoyancy , purity and packaging . osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure.to simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units , it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity `` relative density '' or `` specific gravity '' , i.e . the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material , usually water . thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water.the density of a material varies with temperature and pressure . this variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases . increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density . increasing the temperature of a substance ( with a few exceptions ) decreases its density by increasing its volume . in most materials , heating the bottom of a fluid results in convection of the heat from the bottom to the top , due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid . this causes it to rise relative to more dense unheated material.the reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume , a term sometimes used in thermodynamics . density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density ; rather it increases its mass .

the glock is a series of polymer-framed , short recoil-operated , locked-breech semi-automatic pistols designed and produced by austrian manufacturer glock ges.m.b.h . the firearm entered austrian military and police service by 1982 after it was the top performer in reliability and safety tests.despite initial resistance from the market to accept a perceived `` plastic gun '' due to concerns regarding durability and reliability which proved unfounded , as well as fears that its use of a polymer frame might bypass the detection of the metal detectors in airports , also unfounded , glock pistols have become the company 's most profitable line of products as well as supplying national armed forces , security agencies , and police forces in at least 48 countries . glocks are also popular firearms among civilians for recreational and competition shooting , home- and self-defense , and concealed or open carry . 
islamic architecture comprises the architectural styles of buildings associated with islam . it encompasses both secular and religious styles from the early history of islam to the present day . early islamic architecture was influenced by roman , byzantine , persian , mesopotamian architecture and all other lands which the early muslim conquests conquered in the seventh and eighth centuries . further east , it was also influenced by chinese and mughal architecture as islam spread to southeast asia . later it developed distinct characteristics in the form of buildings , and the decoration of surfaces with islamic calligraphy and geometric and interlace patterned ornament . new architectural elements like cylindrical minarets , muqarnas , arabesque , multifoil were invented . the principal islamic architectural types for large or public buildings are : the mosque , the tomb , the palace , and the fort . from these four types , the vocabulary of islamic architecture is derived and used for other buildings such as public baths , fountains and domestic architecture.many of the buildings which are mentioned in this article are listed as world heritage sites . some of them , like the citadel of aleppo , have suffered significant damage in the ongoing syrian civil war and other wars in the middle east. < ref name= '' unesco 20/6/13 '' > unesco : syria 's six world heritage sites placed on list of world heritage in danger '' . 20 june 2013 , accessed 1 february 2016 < /ref >

alberto r. gonzales ( born august 4 , 1955 ) is an american lawyer who served as the 80th united states attorney general , appointed in february 2005 by president george w. bush , becoming the highest-ranking hispanic american in executive government to date . he was the first hispanic to serve as white house counsel . earlier he had been bush 's general counsel during his governorship of texas . gonzales had also served as secretary of state of texas and then as a texas supreme court justice.gonzales 's tenure as u.s. attorney general was marked by controversy regarding warrantless surveillance of u.s. citizens and the legal authorization of so-called `` enhanced interrogation techniques '' , later generally acknowledged as constituting torture , in the u.s. government 's post-9/11 `` war on terror '' . gonzales had also presided over the firings of several u.s . attorneys who had refused back-channel white house directives to prosecute political enemies , allegedly causing the office of attorney general to become improperly politicized . following calls for his removal , gonzales resigned from the office `` in the best interests of the department , '' on august 27 , 2007 , effective september 17 , 2007.in 2008 , gonzales began a mediation and consulting practice . additionally , he taught a political science course and served as a diversity recruiter at texas tech university . gonzales is currently the dean of belmont university college of law , in nashville , tennessee , where he currently teaches constitutional law , separation of powers , national security law and first amendment law . he was formerly of counsel at a nashville-based law firm , waller lansden dortch & davis , llp where he advised clients on special matters , government investigations and regulatory matters . he often writes opinion pieces for national newspapers and appears on national news programs . 
provenance ( from the french `` provenir '' , 'to come from/forth ' ) is the chronology of the ownership , custody or location of a historical object . the term was originally mostly used in relation to works of art but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields , including archaeology , paleontology , archives , manuscripts , printed books , the circular economy , and science and computing.the primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery , by establishing , as far as practicable , its later history , especially the sequences of its formal ownership , custody and places of storage . the practice has a particular value in helping authenticate objects . comparative techniques , expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends , but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of documentation . the term dates to the 1780s in english . provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term `` chain of custody '' .for museums and the art trade , in addition to helping establish the authorship and authenticity of an object , provenance has become increasingly important in helping establish the moral and legal validity of a chain of custody , given the increasing amount of looted art . these issues first became a major concern regarding works that had changed hands in nazi-controlled areas in europe before and during world war ii . many museums began compiling pro-active registers of such works and their history . recently the same concerns have come to prominence for works of african art , often exported illegally , and antiquities from many parts of the world , but currently especially in iraq , and then syria.in archaeology and paleontology , the derived term provenience is used with a related but very particular meaning , to refer to the location ( in modern research , recorded precisely in three dimensions ) where an artifact or other ancient item was found . `` provenance '' covers an object 's complete documented history . an artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance . 
in nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry , nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller , lighter nuclei . the fission process often produces gamma photons , and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.nuclear fission of heavy elements was discovered on december 17 , 1938 by german otto hahn and his assistant fritz strassmann , and explained theoretically in january 1939 by lise meitner and her nephew otto robert frisch . frisch named the process by analogy with biological fission of living cells . for heavy nuclides , it is an exothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as electromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments ( heating the bulk material where fission takes place ) . like nuclear fusion , in order for fission to produce energy , the total binding energy of the resulting elements must have a greater binding energy than that of the starting element.fission is a form of nuclear transmutation because the resulting fragments are not the same element as the original atom . the two ( or more ) nuclei produced are most often of comparable but slightly different sizes , typically with a mass ratio of products of about 3 to 2 , for common fissile isotopes . most fissions are binary fissions ( producing two charged fragments ) , but occasionally ( 2 to 4 times per 1000 events ) , `` three '' positively charged fragments are produced , in a ternary fission . the smallest of these fragments in ternary processes ranges in size from a proton to an argon nucleus.apart from fission induced by a neutron , harnessed and exploited by humans , a natural form of spontaneous radioactive decay ( not requiring a neutron ) is also referred to as fission , and occurs especially in very high-mass-number isotopes . spontaneous fission was discovered in 1940 by flyorov , petrzhak , and kurchatov in moscow , when they confirmed that , without bombardment by neutrons , the fission rate of uranium was indeed negligible , as predicted by niels bohr ; it was not.the unpredictable composition of the products ( which vary in a broad probabilistic and somewhat chaotic manner ) distinguishes fission from purely quantum tunneling processes such as proton emission , alpha decay , and cluster decay , which give the same products each time . nuclear fission produces energy for nuclear power and drives the explosion of nuclear weapons . both uses are possible because certain substances called nuclear fuels undergo fission when struck by fission neutrons , and in turn emit neutrons when they break apart . this makes a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction possible , releasing energy at a controlled rate in a nuclear reactor or at a very rapid , uncontrolled rate in a nuclear weapon.the amount of free energy contained in nuclear fuel is millions of times the amount of free energy contained in a similar mass of chemical fuel such as gasoline , making nuclear fission a very dense source of energy . the products of nuclear fission , however , are on average far more radioactive than the heavy elements which are normally fissioned as fuel , and remain so for significant amounts of time , giving rise to a nuclear waste problem . concerns over nuclear waste accumulation and over the destructive potential of nuclear weapons are a counterbalance to the peaceful desire to use fission as an energy source .

the water table is the upper surface of the zone of saturation . the zone of saturation is where the pores and fractures of the ground are saturated with water.the water table is the surface where the water pressure head is equal to the atmospheric pressure ( where gauge pressure = 0 ) . it may be visualized as the `` surface '' of the subsurface materials that are saturated with groundwater in a given vicinity.the groundwater may be from precipitation or from groundwater flowing into the aquifer . in areas with sufficient precipitation , water infiltrates through pore spaces in the soil , passing through the unsaturated zone . at increasing depths , water fills in more of the pore spaces in the soils , until a zone of saturation is reached . below the water table , in the phreatic zone ( zone of saturation ) , layers of permeable rock that yield groundwater are called aquifers . in less permeable soils , such as tight bedrock formations and historic lakebed deposits , the water table may be more difficult to define.the water table should not be confused with the water level in a deeper well . if a deeper aquifer has a lower permeable unit that confines the upward flow , then the water level in this aquifer may rise to a level that is greater or less than the elevation of the actual water table . the elevation of the water in this deeper well is dependent upon the pressure in the deeper aquifer and is referred to as the potentiometric surface , not the water table .

in computing , the modulo operation finds the remainder or signed remainder after a division of one number by another ( called the `` modulus '' of the operation ) .given two positive numbers , and , modulo ( abbreviated as ) is the remainder of the euclidean division of by , where is the dividend and is the divisor.for example , the expression `` 5 mod 2 '' would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1 , while `` 9 mod 3 '' would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0 ; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3 . ( doing the division with a calculator will not show the result referred to here by this operation ; the quotient will be expressed as a decimal fraction . ) although typically performed with and both being integers , many computing systems allow other types of numeric operands . the range of numbers for an integer modulo of is 0 to inclusive . ( mod 1 is always 0 ; is undefined , possibly resulting in a division by zero error in programming languages . ) see modular arithmetic for an older and related convention applied in number theory.when either or is negative , the naive definition breaks down , and programming languages differ in how these values are defined . 
in baseball , a number of coaches assist in the smooth functioning of a team . they are assistants to the manager , who determines the lineup and decides how to substitute players during the game . beyond the manager , more than a half dozen coaches may assist the manager in running the team . essentially , baseball coaches are analogous to assistant coaches in other sports , as the baseball manager is to the head coach . 
in physics , the young–laplace equation ( ) is a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids , such as water and air , due to the phenomenon of surface tension or wall tension , although use of the latter is only applicable if assuming that the wall is very thin . the young–laplace equation relates the pressure difference to the shape of the surface or wall and it is fundamentally important in the study of static capillary surfaces . it is a statement of normal stress balance for static fluids meeting at an interface , where the interface is treated as a surface ( zero thickness ) : where formula_2 is the laplace pressure , the pressure difference across the fluid interface ( the exterior pressure minus the interior pressure ) , formula_3 is the surface tension ( or wall tension ) , formula_4 is the unit normal pointing out of the surface , formula_5 is the mean curvature ( defined in the section titled `` mean curvature in fluid mechanics '' ) , and formula_6 and formula_7 are the principal radii of curvature . note that only normal stress is considered , this is because it has been shown that a static interface is possible only in the absence of tangential stress.the equation is named after thomas young , who developed the qualitative theory of surface tension in 1805 , and pierre-simon laplace who completed the mathematical description in the following year . it is sometimes also called the young–laplace–gauss equation , as carl friedrich gauss unified the work of young and laplace in 1830 , deriving both the differential equation and boundary conditions using johann bernoulli 's virtual work principles . 
a resonator is a device or system that exhibits resonance or resonant behavior . that is , it naturally oscillates with greater amplitude at some frequencies , called resonant frequencies , than at other frequencies . the oscillations in a resonator can be either electromagnetic or mechanical ( including acoustic ) . resonators are used to either generate waves of specific frequencies or to select specific frequencies from a signal . musical instruments use acoustic resonators that produce sound waves of specific tones . another example is quartz crystals used in electronic devices such as radio transmitters and quartz watches to produce oscillations of very precise frequency.a cavity resonator is one in which waves exist in a hollow space inside the device . in electronics and radio , microwave cavities consisting of hollow metal boxes are used in microwave transmitters , receivers and test equipment to control frequency , in place of the tuned circuits which are used at lower frequencies . acoustic cavity resonators , in which sound is produced by air vibrating in a cavity with one opening , are known as helmholtz resonators .

akmal shaikh ( 5 april 1956 – 29 december 2009 ) was a pakistani-british businessman who was convicted and executed in china for illegally trafficking approximately 4 kg of heroin . the trial and execution attracted significant media attention in the uk.shaikh was born in pakistan and moved to the united kingdom as a child . after a couple of failed businesses , shaikh moved to poland with his second wife in 2005 with the dream of starting an airline , and later of becoming a pop star . he travelled from poland to china and was arrested by chinese customs officers at ürümqi diwopu international airport on 12 september 2007 with of heroin hidden in a compartment in his baggage . shaikh 's defence team pleaded ignorance of the existence of the drugs , although his lawyers said that the evidence against shaikh was `` overwhelming '' . reprieve , an anti-death penalty organisation , argued that shaikh suffered from mental illness which was exploited by criminals who tricked him into transporting the heroin on the promise of a recording contract.shaikh , who had never been assessed by mental health experts , denied he was mentally ill . he had requested a psychiatric evaluation to prove he was sane , but the requests were refused by chinese authorities on the grounds that prc laws required defendants to first provide past medical records showing evidence of a mental disorder before such evaluations could be undertaken . appeals for clemency were made by his family and by british government officials . after two appeals , the supreme court confirmed the death sentence he was given at his first trial in october 2008 , and shaikh was executed by lethal injection in ürümqi on 29 december 2009 . it was reported that shaikh was the first person with citizenship of a european country to be executed in china since antonio riva in 1951 . lau fat-wai , a portuguese citizen , also faced drug trafficking charges back in 2006 , before akmal shaikh , but mr. lau 's death sentence was only carried out early in 2013.britain made 27 official representations to the chinese government ; the chinese ambassador to london was summoned twice to meet british foreign office ministers , once after the execution . senior british politicians strongly condemned the execution , and were disappointed that clemency was not granted , while human rights groups and some western legal experts in chinese law criticised the lack of due process ; united nations special rapporteur philip alston said the refusal to assess shaikh 's mental health was a violation of international law . the chinese embassy in britain said shaikh had no `` previous medical record '' of mental illness and that his `` rights and interests were properly respected and guaranteed '' . it said the chinese stance underlined the `` strong resentment '' felt by its public to drug traffickers , in part based on `` the bitter memory of history '' – a reference to the first and second opium wars . a professor of criminal law at the east china university of political science and law said the administration of the death penalty related to a country 's history , culture and other conditions : `` it 's human nature to plead for a criminal who is from the same country or the same family , but judicial independence should be fully respected and everyone should be equal before the law .

in celestial mechanics , orbital resonance occurs when orbiting bodies exert regular , periodic gravitational influence on each other , usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio of small integers . most commonly this relationship is found for a pair of objects . the physical principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a swing , where the orbit and the swing both have a natural frequency , and the other body doing the `` pushing '' will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion . orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies ( `` i.e . `` , their ability to alter or constrain each other 's orbits ) . in most cases , this results in an `` unstable '' interaction , in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists . under some circumstances , a resonant system can be self-correcting and thus stable . examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of jupiter 's moons ganymede , europa and io , and the 2:3 resonance between pluto and neptune . unstable resonances with saturn 's inner moons give rise to gaps in the rings of saturn . the special case of 1:1 resonance between bodies with similar orbital radii causes large solar system bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits ; this is part of the much more extensive process of clearing the neighbourhood , an effect that is used in the current definition of a planet.a binary resonance ratio in this article should be interpreted as the `` ratio of number of orbits '' completed in the same time interval , rather than as the `` ratio of orbital periods '' , which would be the inverse ratio . thus the 2:3 ratio above means pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes neptune to complete three . in the case of resonance relationships among three or more bodies , either type of ratio may be used ( in such cases the smallest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other ) and the type of ratio will be specified .

cyclospora cayetanensis is a coccidian parasite that causes a diarrheal disease called cyclosporiasis in humans and possibly in other primates . originally reported as a novel pathogen of probable coccidian nature in the 1980s and described in the early 1990s , it was virtually unknown in developed countries until awareness increased due to several outbreaks linked with fecally contaminated imported produce . `` c. cayetanensis '' has since emerged as an endemic cause of diarrheal disease in tropical countries and a cause of traveler 's diarrhea and food-borne infections in developed nations . this species was placed in the genus `` cyclospora '' because of the spherical shape of its sporocysts . the specific name refers to the cayetano heredia university in lima , peru , where early epidemiological and taxonomic work was done . 
the fifa beach soccer world cup is an international beach soccer competition contested by the men 's national teams of the member associations of fifa , the sport 's global governing body.the tournament was established in 1995 as the `` beach soccer world championship '' , taking place every year for the next decade under the supervision of beach soccer worldwide ( bsww ) and its predecessors . due to the sport 's rapid growth , fifa took an interest in the sport , and as the main tournament in world beach soccer , it joined hands with bsww in 2005 to take over the organization of the competition , re-branding it as an official fifa tournament . since 2009 , the tournament has taken place every two years to allow continental tournaments to flourish without the burden of the world cup qualifiers crowding the schedule every 12 months . the growing global popularity of beach soccer resulted in fifa 's decision to move the stage of the world cup from its native home in brazil to other parts of the globe to capitalise on and continue to stimulate global interest . the first edition held outside brazil was in 2008 in marseille , france.the current tournament format lasts over approximately 10 days and involves 16 teams initially competing in four groups of four teams . the group winners and runners-up advance to a series of knock-out stages until the champion is crowned . the losing semi-finalists play each other in a play-off match to determine the third and fourth-placed teams.the most recent edition in 2019 was held in asunción , paraguay , and crowned portugal as champions for the second time – after defeating italy 4–6 in the final . 
spin welding is a friction welding technique used on thermoplastic materials , in which the parts to be welded are heated by friction . the heat may be generated by turning on a lathe , a drill press , or a milling machine , where one part is driven by the chuck , and the other is held stationary with the spinning part driven against it . this is continued until the heat of friction between the parts reaches a sufficient level for the parts to weld . the stationary part is then released to spin as well , while pressure is applied along the axis of rotation , holding the parts together as they cool.in the 1970s , mattel sold a toy called `` spinwelder '' , which consisted of a high-speed motor in a handle that spun a small plastic welding rod against a plastic joint to form a bond . mattel sold construction kits sold for the purpose of assembling with the spinwelder .

circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis . in the most common procedure , the foreskin is opened , adhesions are removed , and the foreskin is separated from the glans . after that , a circumcision device may be placed , and then the foreskin is cut off . topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress . the procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons . medically , circumcision is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis and balanoposthitis that do not resolve with other treatments , and for chronic urinary tract infections ( utis ) . it is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.the positions of the world 's major medical organizations range from a belief that elective circumcision of babies and children carries significant risks and offers no medical benefits to a belief that the procedure has a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks . no major medical organization recommends circumcising all males , and no major medical organization recommends banning the procedure . ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and human rights have been raised over the circumcision of babies and children for non-medical reasons ; for these reasons , the procedure is controversial.male circumcision reduces the risk of hiv infection among heterosexual men in sub-saharan africa . consequently , the world health organization ( who ) recommends consideration of circumcision as part of a comprehensive hiv prevention program in areas with high rates of hiv . the effectiveness of using circumcision to prevent hiv in the developed world is unclear ; however , there is some evidence that circumcision reduces hiv infection risk for men who have sex with men . circumcision is also associated with reduced rates of cancer-causing forms of human papillomavirus ( hpv ) , and utis . it also decreases the risk of cancer of the penis via effectively curing phimosis . prevention of these conditions is not seen as a justification for routine circumcision of infants in the western world . studies of other sexually transmitted infections also suggest that circumcision is protective , including for men who have sex with men . a 2010 review found circumcisions performed by medical providers to have a typical complication rate of 1.5 % for babies and 6 % for older children , with few cases of severe complications . bleeding , infection , and the removal of either too much or too little foreskin are the most common acute complications . meatal stenosis is the most common long term complication . complication rates are higher when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator , in unsterile conditions , or in older children . circumcision does not appear to have a negative impact on sexual function.an estimated one-third of males worldwide are circumcised . circumcision is most common among muslims and jews ( among whom it is near-universal for religious reasons ) , and in the united states , parts of southeast asia , and africa . it is relatively rare for non-religious reasons in europe , latin america , parts of southern africa , and most of asia . the origin of circumcision is not known with certainty ; the oldest documented evidence for it comes from ancient egypt . various theories have been proposed as to its origin including as a religious sacrifice and as a rite of passage marking a boy 's entrance into adulthood . it is part of religious law in judaism and is an established practice in islam , coptic christianity , and the ethiopian orthodox church . the word circumcision is from latin `` circumcidere '' , meaning `` to cut around '' .

a vertical-lift bridge or just lift bridge is a type of movable bridge in which a span rises vertically while remaining parallel with the deck.the vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridge . generally speaking they cost less to build for longer moveable spans . the counterweights in a vertical lift are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck , whereas bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted . as a result , heavier materials can be used in the deck , and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use.although most vertical-lift bridges use towers , each equipped with counterweights , some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck . an example is the span bridge at st paul avenue in milwaukee ( see also table bridges ) . another design used balance beams to lift the deck , with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers . an example of this kind was built at la salle in illinois , usa.the biggest disadvantage to the vertical-lift bridge ( in comparison with many other designs ) is the height restriction for vessels passing under it . this is a result of the deck remaining suspended above the passageway .

the chelyabinsk meteor was a superbolide that entered earth 's atmosphere over russia on 15 february 2013 at about 09:20 yekt ( 03:20 utc ) . it was caused by an approximately near-earth asteroid with a speed of 19.16 ± 0.15 kilometres per second ( 60,000–69,000 km/h or 40,000–42,900 mph ) . it quickly became a brilliant superbolide meteor over the southern ural region . the light from the meteor was brighter than the sun , visible up to away . it was observed over a wide area of the region and in neighbouring republics . some eyewitnesses also felt intense heat from the fireball.due to its high velocity and shallow angle of atmospheric entry , the object exploded in an air burst over chelyabinsk oblast , at a height of around . the explosion generated a bright flash , producing a hot cloud of dust and gas that penetrated to , and many surviving small fragmentary meteorites , as well as a large shock wave . the bulk of the object 's energy was absorbed by the atmosphere , with a total kinetic energy before atmospheric impact estimated from infrasound and seismic measurements to be equivalent to the blast yield of 400–500 kilotons of tnt ( about 1.4–1.8 pj ) range – 26 to 33 times as much energy as that released from the atomic bomb detonated at hiroshima.the object was undetected before its atmospheric entry , in part because its radiant ( source direction ) was close to the sun . its explosion created panic among local residents , and about 1,500 people were injured seriously enough to seek medical treatment . all of the injuries were due to indirect effects rather than the meteor itself , mainly from broken glass from windows that were blown in when the shock wave arrived , minutes after the superbolide 's flash . some 7,200 buildings in six cities across the region were damaged by the explosion 's shock wave , and authorities scrambled to help repair the structures in sub-freezing temperatures.with an estimated initial mass of about 12,000–13,000 tonnes ( 13,000–14,000 short tons , heavier than the eiffel tower ) , and measuring about in diameter , it is the largest known natural object to have entered earth 's atmosphere since the 1908 tunguska event , which destroyed a wide , remote , forested , and very sparsely populated area of siberia . the chelyabinsk meteor is also the only meteor confirmed to have resulted in many injuries . no deaths were reported.the earlier-predicted and well-publicized close approach of a larger asteroid on the same day , the roughly 367943 duende , occurred about 16 hours later ; the very different orbits of the two objects showed they were unrelated to each other .

a mineral is , broadly speaking , a solid chemical compound that occurs naturally in pure form . minerals are most commonly associated with rocks due to the presence of minerals within rocks . these rocks may consist of one type of mineral , or may be an aggregate of two or more different types of minerals , spacially segregated into distinct phases . compounds that occur only in living beings are usually excluded , but some minerals are often biogenic ( such as calcite ) or are organic compounds in the sense of chemistry ( such as mellite ) . moreover , living beings often synthesize inorganic minerals ( such as hydroxylapatite ) that also occur in rocks.in geology and mineralogy , the term `` mineral '' is usually reserved for mineral species : crystalline compounds with a fairly well-defined chemical composition and a specific crystal structure . some natural solid substances without a definite crystalline structure , such as opal or obsidian , are then more properly called mineraloids . if a chemical compound may occur naturally with different crystal structures , each structure is considered a different mineral species . thus , for example , quartz and stishovite are two different minerals consisting of the same compound , silicon dioxide.the international mineralogical association ( ima ) is the world 's premier standard body for the definition and nomenclature of mineral species . , the ima recognizes 5,562 official mineral species out of more than 5,750 proposed or traditional ones.the chemical composition of a named mineral species may vary somewhat by the inclusion of small amounts of impurities . specific varieties of a species sometimes have conventional or official names of their own . for example , amethyst is a purple variety of the mineral species quartz . some mineral species can have variable proportions of two or more chemical elements that occupy equivalent positions in the mineral 's structure ; for example , the formula of mackinawite is given as , meaning , where `` x '' is a variable number between 0 and 9 . sometimes a mineral with variable composition is split into separate species , more or less arbitrarily , forming a mineral group ; that is the case of the silicates , the olivine group.besides the essential chemical composition and crystal structure , the description of a mineral species usually includes its common physical properties such as habit , hardness , lustre , diaphaneity , colour , streak , tenacity , cleavage , fracture , parting , specific gravity , magnetism , fluorescence , radioactivity , as well as its taste or smell and its reaction to acid.minerals are classified by key chemical constituents ; the two dominant systems are the dana classification and the strunz classification . silicate minerals comprise approximately 90 % of the earth 's crust . other important mineral groups include the native elements , sulfides , oxides , halides , carbonates , sulfates , and phosphates .

wayne thiebaud ( ; born november 15 , 1920 ) is an american painter known for his colorful works depicting commonplace objects—pies , lipsticks , paint cans , ice cream cones , pastries , and hot dogs—as well as for his landscapes and figure paintings . thiebaud is associated with the pop art movement because of his interest in objects of mass culture , although his early works , executed during the fifties and sixties , slightly predate the works of the classic pop artists . thiebaud uses heavy pigment and exaggerated colors to depict his subjects , and the well-defined shadows characteristic of advertisements are almost always included in his work . 
gentry is a largely historical term for the european social class of people who were `` well-born , genteel and well-bred '' . in its widest sense , it refers to people of good social position , from families of long descent , and connected to landed estates or the upper levels of the clergy ( especially an established church ) . the gentry largely consisted of landowners who could live entirely from rental income , or at least had a country estate ; some were gentleman farmers.the british social class of landed gentry was distinct from , and socially below , the country 's peerage , although in fact some of them were wealthier than some peers , and many were close relatives . the gentry were typically armigerous ( having a coat of arms ) , but , owing to the primogeniture rules of the peerage of england ( and elsewhere in the united kingdom ) , most gentry did not have titles of nobility . in contrast , in continental europe where nobility and titles were inherited by a family , a greater proportion of the population held titles . this was the case with the french and polish landed gentry.there were analogous traditional social elite strata based in cities . the adjective `` patrician '' ( `` of or like a person of high social rank '' ) describes the governing elites in a medieval metropolis , such as those of the free cities of italy ( venice and genoa ) , and the free imperial cities of germany , switzerland , and the hanseatic league.the term `` gentry '' by itself , so peter coss argues , is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies . any particular model may not fit a specific society , yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable . the word derives from the old french `` genterie '' , from `` gentil '' , 'high-born , noble ' . 
muon-catalyzed fusion ( μcf ) is a process allowing nuclear fusion to take place at temperatures significantly lower than the temperatures required for thermonuclear fusion , even at room temperature or lower . it is one of the few known ways of catalyzing nuclear fusion reactions.muons are unstable subatomic particles . they are similar to electrons , but are about 207 times more massive . if a muon replaces one of the electrons in a hydrogen molecule , the nuclei are consequently drawn 196 times closer than in a normal molecule , due to the reduced mass being 196 times the mass of an electron.when the nuclei are this close together , the probability of nuclear fusion is greatly increased , to the point where a significant number of fusion events can happen at room temperature.the method used to create muons on earth have since 1950 been to accelerate protons in large cyclotron facilities . when accelerated protons hit a graphite target and creates positive and negative pions which decay to positive and negative muons . magnets are then used to collimate the muon beam and separate positive and negative muons . only the negative muons can initiate muon catalyzed fusion.cyclotron proton acceleration techniques for creating large numbers of muons require far more energy than would be produced by the resulting catalyzed nuclear fusion reactions and this is one of the reasons muon catalyzed fusion reactors have n't been constructed.a new technique on pulsed laser driven muon source has the last decade been developed at gothenburg university by a research group lead by prof. leif holmlid and sindre zeiner-gundersen which has greatly reduced the energy to create negative muons.the research and development on laser-driven muon sources have since 2015 greatly reduced the energy of creating muons from 5 gev/u in cyclotrons down to 0,003 gev/u with a laser-driven muon source . muon-catalyzed fusion reactors utilizing laser-driven muon sources can theoretically reach an energy gain of 2000 from electric to thermal energy on a complete muon-catalyzed fusion power plant.since the development of laser-driven muon sources started the research on muon catalyzed fusion reactors has accelerated all over the world . the leading companies working on muon catalyzed fusion are today star scientific in australia and norrønt fusion energy as based in norway and sweden.each muon has about a 1 % chance of `` sticking '' to the alpha particle produced by the nuclear fusion of a deuteron with a triton , the sticking problem is difficult to solve . a bonus on muon-catalyzed fusion is that one muon from a muon source can catalyze a few hundred deuterium-tritium nuclear fusion reactions which is beneficial since the intensity of muons can be lower.the sticking problem and the cyclotron technology on creating muons have up to today prevented muon-catalyzed fusion from becoming a practical power source , limiting it to a laboratory curiosity.to create useful room-temperature muon-catalyzed fusion , reactors would need a cheaper , more efficient muon sources and/or a way for each individual muon to catalyze many more fusion reactions . laser-driven muon sources seem to be the economical tipping point for making muon-catalyzed fusion reactors viable.norront fusion energy , a private held nordic company is in the development phase on constructing a muon-catalyzed fusion power plant with a laser-driven muon source .

moral orel is an american adult stop-motion animated television series , which originally aired on adult swim from december 13 , 2005 to december 18 , 2008 . the series has been described as `` '' davey and goliath '' ... meets `` south park '' '' . however , dino stamatopoulos , the show 's creator , is wary of the comparison with `` davey and goliath '' , telling the `` new york times '' that `` moral orel '' grew out of a concept for a send-up of a `` leave it to beaver '' -style 1950s sitcom that would star iggy pop.at the 2008 san diego comic-con , stamatopoulos announced that the show would not be renewed for a fourth season . the final season was aired interspersed with repeats from the first two seasons , since many of the episodes took place in parallel with events of past episodes . the event , which was called `` 44 nights of orel '' , was hosted by stamatopoulos and others and started on october 6 , 2008 , running through december 18 , when the series finale premiered . a special entitled `` beforel orel '' later aired on november 19 , 2012 . 
the zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third one , then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other . accordingly , thermal equilibrium between systems is a transitive relation.two systems are said to be in the relation of thermal equilibrium if they are linked by a wall permeable only to heat and they do not change over time . as a convenience of language , systems are sometimes also said to be in a relation of thermal equilibrium if they are not linked so as to be able to transfer heat to each other , but would still not do so ( even ) if they were connected by a wall permeable only to heat.the physical meaning is expressed by maxwell in the words : `` all heat is of the same kind '' . another statement of the law is `` all diathermal walls are equivalent '' .the law is important for the mathematical formulation of thermodynamics , which needs the assertion that the relation of thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation . this information is needed for a mathematical definition of temperature that will agree with the physical existence of valid thermometers . 
mohammed zahir shah ( , ; 15 october 1914 – 23 july 2007 ) was the last king of afghanistan , reigning from 8 november 1933 until he was deposed on 17 july 1973 . he expanded afghanistan 's diplomatic relations with many countries , including with both cold war sides . in the 1950s , zahir shah began modernizing the country , culminating in the creation of a new constitution and a constitutional monarchy system . his long reign was marked by peace in the country that was lost afterwards.while on vacation in italy , zahir shah 's regime was overthrown in a `` white coup '' in 1973 by his cousin and former prime minister , mohammed daoud khan , who established a republic . he remained in exile near rome until 2002 , returning to afghanistan after the end of the taliban government . he was given the title father of the nation , which he held until his death in 2007 .

a domestic worker is a person who works within an employer 's household . the term `` domestic service '' applies to the equivalent occupational category . in traditional english contexts , such a person was said to be `` in service '' . domestic helpers perform a variety of household services for an individual or a family , from providing care for children and elderly dependents to housekeeping , including cleaning and household maintenance . other responsibilities may include cooking , laundry and ironing , shopping for food and other household errands . such work has always needed to be done but before the industrial revolution and the advent of labour saving devices , it was physically much harder.some domestic helpers live within their employer 's household . in some cases , the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued . however , for the most part , domestic work tends to be demanding and is commonly considered to be undervalued , despite often being necessary . although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries , it is often not extensively enforced . in many jurisdictions , domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses , including slavery . `` servant '' is an older english word for `` domestic worker '' , though not all servants worked inside the home . domestic service , or the employment of people for wages in their employer 's residence , was sometimes simply called `` service '' and has often been part of a hierarchical system . in britain a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the victorian era , perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the edwardian period ( a period known in the united states as the gilded age and in france as the belle époque ) , which reflected the limited social mobility before world war i .

the philistines were an ancient people who lived on the south coast of canaan from the 12th century bc until 604 bc , when they were exiled to mesopotamia by king nebuchadnezzar ii . they are known for their biblical conflict with the israelites . though the primary source of information about the philistines is the hebrew bible , they are first attested to in reliefs at the temple of ramses iii at medinet habu , in which they are called ( accepted as cognate with hebrew ) ; the parallel assyrian term is , , or .the first reference to philistines in the hebrew bible is in the table of nations , in which they are said to descend from casluhim , son of mizraim ( egypt ) . however , the philistines of genesis who are friendly to abraham are identified by rabbinic sources as distinct from the warlike people described in deuteronomistic history . deuteronomist sources describe the `` five lords of the philistines '' as based in five city-states of the southwestern levant : gaza , ashkelon , ashdod , ekron , and gath , from wadi gaza in the south to the yarqon river in the north . this description portrays them at one period of time as among the kingdom of israel 's most dangerous enemies . in contrast , the septuagint uses the term ( ) instead of `` philistines , '' which means simply 'other nations'.several theories are given about the origins of the philistines . the hebrew bible mentions in two places that they originate from caphtor ( possibly crete ) . the septuagint also connects the philistines to other biblical groups such as caphtorim and the cherethites and pelethites , which have been identified with the island of crete . this has led to the modern theory of philistines having an aegean origin . in 2016 , a large philistine cemetery was discovered near ashkelon , containing more than 150 dead buried in oval-shaped graves . a 2019 genetic study found that , while all three ashkelon populations derive most of their ancestry from the local levantine gene pool , the early iron age population was genetically distinct due to a european-related admixture ; this genetic signal is no longer detectable in the later iron age population . according to the authors , the admixture was likely due to a `` gene flow from a european-related gene pool '' during the bronze to iron age transition , which supports the theory that a migration event occurred . 
rodinia ( from the russian родить , `` rodit '' , meaning `` to beget , to give birth '' , or родина , `` rodina '' , meaning `` motherland , birthplace '' ) was a neoproterozoic supercontinent that assembled 1.1–0.9 billion years ago and broke up 750–633 million years ago.rodinia formed at c. 1.23 ga by accretion and collision of fragments produced by breakup of an older supercontinent , columbia , assembled by global-scale 2.0–1.8 ga collisional events.rodinia broke up in the neoproterozoic with its continental fragments reassembled to form pannotia 633–573 million years ago . in contrast with pannotia , little is known yet about the exact configuration and geodynamic history of rodinia . paleomagnetic evidence provides some clues to the paleolatitude of individual pieces of the earth 's crust , but not to their longitude , which geologists have pieced together by comparing similar geologic features , often now widely dispersed.the extreme cooling of the global climate around 717–635 million years ago ( the so-called snowball earth of the cryogenian period ) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the subsequent ediacaran and cambrian periods are thought to have been triggered by the breaking up of rodinia or to a slowing down of tectonic processes .

a zeppelin is a type of rigid airship named after the german count ferdinand von zeppelin ( ) who pioneered rigid airship development at the beginning of the 20th century . zeppelin 's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893 . they were patented in germany in 1895 and in the united states in 1899 . after the outstanding success of the zeppelin design , the word `` zeppelin '' came to be commonly used to refer to all rigid airships . zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by deutsche luftschiffahrts-ag ( delag ) , the world 's first airline in revenue service . by mid-1914 , delag had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights . during world war i , the german military made extensive use of zeppelins as bombers and as scouts , killing over 500 people in bombing raids in britain.the defeat of germany in 1918 temporarily slowed the airship business . although delag established a scheduled daily service between berlin , munich , and friedrichshafen in 1919 , the airships built for this service eventually had to be surrendered under the terms of the treaty of versailles , which also prohibited germany from building large airships . an exception was made allowing the construction of one airship for the united states navy , which saved the company from extinction . in 1926 the restrictions on airship construction were lifted , and with the aid of donations from the public , work was started on the construction of lz 127 `` graf zeppelin '' . this revived the company 's fortunes , and during the 1930s , the airships `` graf zeppelin '' and the larger lz 129 `` hindenburg '' operated regular transatlantic flights from germany to north america and brazil . the art deco spire of the empire state building was originally designed to serve as a mooring mast for zeppelins and other airships , although it was found that high winds made this impossible and the plan was abandoned . the `` hindenburg '' disaster in 1937 , along with political and economic issues , hastened the demise of zeppelins .

thallium is a chemical element with the symbol tl and atomic number 81 . it is a gray post-transition metal that is not found free in nature . when isolated , thallium resembles tin , but discolors when exposed to air . chemists william crookes and claude-auguste lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861 , in residues of sulfuric acid production . both used the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy , in which thallium produces a notable green spectral line . thallium , from greek , , meaning `` a green shoot or twig '' , was named by crookes . it was isolated by both lamy and crookes in 1862 ; lamy by electrolysis , and crookes by precipitation and melting of the resultant powder . crookes exhibited it as a powder precipitated by zinc at the international exhibition , which opened on 1 may that year.thallium tends to form the +3 and +1 oxidation states . the +3 state resembles that of the other elements in group 13 ( boron , aluminium , gallium , indium ) . however , the +1 state , which is far more prominent in thallium than the elements above it , recalls the chemistry of alkali metals , and thallium ( i ) ions are found geologically mostly in potassium-based ores , and ( when ingested ) are handled in many ways like potassium ions ( k ) by ion pumps in living cells.commercially , thallium is produced not from potassium ores , but as a byproduct from refining of heavy-metal sulfide ores . approximately 60–70 % of thallium production is used in the electronics industry , and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing . it is also used in infrared detectors . the radioisotope thallium-201 ( as the soluble chloride tlcl ) is used in small amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan , during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.soluble thallium salts ( many of which are nearly tasteless ) are toxic , and they were historically used in rat poisons and insecticides . use of these compounds has been restricted or banned in many countries , because of their nonselective toxicity . thallium poisoning usually results in hair loss , although this characteristic symptom does not always surface . because of its historic popularity as a murder weapon , thallium has gained notoriety as `` the poisoner 's poison '' and `` inheritance powder '' ( alongside arsenic ) . 
women 's suffrage is the right of women to vote in elections . beginning in the mid-19th century , aside from the work being done by women for broad-based economic and political equality and for social reforms , women sought to change voting laws to allow them to vote . national and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards that objective , especially the international woman suffrage alliance ( founded in 1904 in berlin , germany ) , as well as for equal civil rights for women.many instances occurred in recent centuries where women were selectively given , then stripped of , the right to vote . the first province in the world to award and maintain women’s suffrage continuously , was wyoming territory in 1869 , and the first sovereign nation was norway in 1913 . in the years after 1869 , a number of provinces held by the british and russian empires conferred women’s suffrage , and some of these became sovereign nations at a later point , like new zealand , australia , and finland . women who owned property gained the right to vote in the isle of man in 1881 , and in 1893 , women in the then british colony of new zealand were granted the right to vote . in australia , non-aboriginal women progressively gained the right to vote between 1894 and 1911 ( federally in 1902 ) . prior to independence , the russian grand duchy of finland women were the first in the world to gain racially-equal suffrage , with both the right to vote and to stand as candidates in 1906 . most major western powers extended voting rights to women in the interwar period , including canada ( 1917 ) , britain and germany ( 1918 ) , austria and the netherlands ( 1919 ) and the united states ( 1920 ) . notable exceptions in europe were france , where women could not vote until 1944 , greece ( 1952 ) , and switzerland ( 1971 ) . now that saudi arabia has granted voting rights to women ( 2015 ) , women can vote in every country that has elections.leslie hume argues that the first world war changed the popular mood : the women 's contribution to the war effort challenged the notion of women 's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were , both by constitution and temperament , unfit to vote . if women could work in munitions factories , it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the voting booth . but the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work ; the point was that women 's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women 's entry into the public arena.extended political campaigns by women and their supporters have generally been necessary to gain legislation or constitutional amendments for women 's suffrage . in many countries , limited suffrage for women was granted before universal suffrage for men ; for instance , literate women or property owners were granted suffrage before all men received it . the united nations encouraged women 's suffrage in the years following world war ii , and the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women ( 1979 ) identifies it as a basic right with 189 countries currently being parties to this convention .

elephant shrews , also called jumping shrews or sengis , are small insectivorous mammals native to africa , belonging to the family macroscelididae , in the order macroscelidea . their traditional common english name `` elephant shrew '' comes from a perceived resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant , and their superficial similarity with shrews ( family soricidae ) in the order eulipotyphla . however , phylogenetic analysis revealed that elephant shrews are not classified with true shrews , but are in fact more closely related to elephants than shrews . in 1997 , the biologist jonathan kingdon proposed that they instead be called `` sengis '' ( singular `` sengi '' ) , a term derived from the bantu languages of africa , and in 1998 , they were classified into the new clade afrotheria.they are widely distributed across the southern part of africa , and although common nowhere , can be found in almost any type of habitat , from the namib desert to boulder-strewn outcrops in south africa to thick forest . one species , the north african elephant shrew , remains in the semiarid , mountainous country in the far northwest of the continent . the somali elephant shrew went missing from 1968 to 2020 but was rediscovered by a group of scientists in djibouti.the creature is one of the fastest small mammals , having been recorded to reach speeds of . compared to other mammalian insectivores , sengis have relatively large brains .

the hermetic order of the golden dawn ( ; or , more commonly , the golden dawn ( `` aurora aurea '' ) ) was a secret society devoted to the study and practice of the occult , metaphysics , and paranormal activities during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . known as a magical order , the hermetic order of the golden dawn was active in great britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development . many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions , such as wicca and thelema , were inspired by the golden dawn , which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century western occultism.the three founders , william robert woodman , william wynn westcott and samuel liddell mathers , were freemasons . westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the golden dawn.the golden dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation like the masonic lodges ; however women were admitted on an equal basis with men . the `` golden dawn '' was the first of three orders , although all three are often collectively referred to as the `` golden dawn '' . the first order taught esoteric philosophy based on the hermetic qabalah and personal development through study and awareness of the four classical elements as well as the basics of astrology , tarot divination , and geomancy . the second or `` inner '' order , the `` rosae rubeae et aureae crucis '' , taught magic , including scrying , astral travel , and alchemy . the third order was that of the `` secret chiefs '' , who were said to be highly skilled ; they supposedly directed the activities of the lower two orders by spirit communication with the chiefs of the second order . 
the triple alliance was an agreement between germany , austria-hungary , and italy . it was formed on 20 may 1882 and renewed periodically until it expired in 1915 during world war i. germany and austria-hungary had been closely allied since 1879 . italy was looking for support against france shortly after it lost north african ambitions to the french . each member promised mutual support in the event of an attack by any other great power . the treaty provided that germany and austria-hungary were to assist italy if it was attacked by france without provocation . in turn , italy would assist germany if attacked by france . in the event of a war between austria-hungary and russia , italy promised to remain neutral . the existence and membership of the treaty were well known , but its exact provisions were kept secret until 1919.when the treaty was renewed in february 1887 , italy gained an empty promise of german support of italian colonial ambitions in north africa in return for italy 's continued friendship . austria-hungary had to be pressured by german chancellor otto von bismarck into accepting the principles of consultation and mutual agreement with italy on any territorial changes initiated in the balkans or on the coasts and islands of the adriatic and aegean seas . italy and austria-hungary did not overcome their basic conflict of interest in that region despite the treaty . in 1891 attempts were made to join britain to the triplice , which , though unsuccessful , were widely believed to have succeeded in russian diplomatic circles.shortly after renewing the alliance in june 1902 , italy secretly extended a similar guarantee to france . by a particular agreement , neither austria-hungary nor italy would change the status quo in the balkans without previous consultation.on 18 october 1883 carol i of romania , through his prime minister ion c. brătianu , had also secretly pledged to support the triple alliance , but he later remained neutral in the first world war due to viewing austria-hungary as the aggressor . on 1 november 1902 , five months after the triple alliance was renewed , italy reached an understanding with france that each would remain neutral in the event of an attack on the other.when austria-hungary found itself at war in august 1914 with the rival triple entente , italy proclaimed its neutrality , considering austria-hungary the aggressor . italy also defaulted on the obligation to consult and agree to compensations before changing the status quo in the balkans , as agreed in 1912 renewal of the triple alliance . following parallel negotiation with both triple alliance ( which aimed to keep italy neutral ) and the triple entente ( which aimed to make italy enter the conflict ) , italy sided with the triple entente and declared war on austria-hungary .

dynamical systems theory is an area of mathematics used to describe the behavior of the complex dynamical systems , usually by employing differential equations or difference equations . when differential equations are employed , the theory is called `` continuous dynamical systems '' . from a physical point of view , continuous dynamical systems is a generalization of classical mechanics , a generalization where the equations of motion are postulated directly and are not constrained to be euler–lagrange equations of a least action principle . when difference equations are employed , the theory is called `` discrete dynamical systems '' . when the time variable runs over a set that is discrete over some intervals and continuous over other intervals or is any arbitrary time-set such as a cantor set , one gets dynamic equations on time scales . some situations may also be modeled by mixed operators , such as differential-difference equations.this theory deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems , and studies the nature of , and when possible the solutions of , the equations of motion of systems that are often primarily mechanical or otherwise physical in nature , such as planetary orbits and the behaviour of electronic circuits , as well as systems that arise in biology , economics , and elsewhere . much of modern research is focused on the study of chaotic systems.this field of study is also called just `` dynamical systems '' , `` mathematical dynamical systems theory '' or the `` mathematical theory of dynamical systems '' .

in biology , a species ( ) is the basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank of an organism , as well as a unit of biodiversity . a species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . other ways of defining species include their karyotype , dna sequence , morphology , behaviour or ecological niche . in addition , paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction can not be examined.the total number of species is estimated to be between 8 and 8.7 million . however the vast majority of them are not studied or documented and it may take over 1000 years to fully catalogue them all.all species ( except viruses ) are given a two-part name , a `` binomial '' . the first part of a binomial is the genus to which the species belongs . the second part is called the specific name or the specific epithet ( in botanical nomenclature , also sometimes in zoological nomenclature ) . for example , `` boa constrictor '' is one of four species of the genus `` boa '' , with `` constrictor '' being the species’ epithet.while the definitions given above may seem adequate , when looked at more closely they represent problematic species concepts . for example , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , and in a ring species . also , among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . though none of these are entirely satisfactory definitions , scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . if species were fixed and clearly distinct from one another , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another.species were seen from the time of aristotle until the 18th century as fixed categories that could be arranged in a hierarchy , the great chain of being . in the 19th century , biologists grasped that species could evolve given sufficient time . charles darwin 's 1859 book `` on the origin of species '' explained how species could arise by natural selection . that understanding was greatly extended in the 20th century through genetics and population ecology . genetic variability arises from mutations and recombination , while organisms themselves are mobile , leading to geographical isolation and genetic drift with varying selection pressures . genes can sometimes be exchanged between species by horizontal gene transfer ; new species can arise rapidly through hybridisation and polyploidy ; and species may become extinct for a variety of reasons . viruses are a special case , driven by a balance of mutation and selection , and can be treated as quasispecies . 
in 1999 , giant baba died and the promotion was ran by motoko baba . misawa was named president but left in 2000 after disagreements with motoko . misawa created pro wrestling noah and every single native wrestler besides masanobu fuchi and toshiaki kawada left all japan . this led to a loss of all japan 's tv deal and a period of hardship for the company . in 2001 , they entered a cross-promotion agreement with new japan pro-wrestling which proved very successful , allowing all japan to remain one of the larger promotions in the country , although now firmly behind njpw.in january 2002 , keiji mutoh defected to all japan , and was officially appointed as its new president that september . by mid-2005 , all japan 's attendance had dropped and the promotion seemed to be in trouble again but by 2007 had new sponsors and seemed to have recovered . after misawa and most of the other wrestlers left the promotion , there was a lull in developing new stars until the likes of kai , suwama , hama and t28 debuted from the mid-2000s onward and helped restrengthen the company . with established stars mutoh , kojima , funaki and minoru suzuki anchoring the promotion , the younger wrestlers were given time to grow and by 2010 were set to help lead all japan . while still without a great tv deal , all japan has operated consistently since 1972 , making it the second-longest running promotion in japan . 
the treaty of rome , officially the treaty establishing the european economic community ( or eec treaty in short ) brought about the creation of the european economic community ( eec ) , the best-known of the european communities ( ec ) . it was signed on 25 march 1957 by belgium , france , italy , luxembourg , the netherlands and west germany and came into force on 1 january 1958 . under the name treaty on the functioning of the european union , it remains one of the two most important treaties in the modern-day european union ( eu ) .the teec proposed the progressive reduction of customs duties and the establishment of a customs union . it proposed to create a single market for goods , labour , services , and capital across the eec 's member states . it also proposed the creation of a common agriculture policy , a common transport policy and a european social fund , and established the european commission.the treaty has been amended on several occasions since 1957 . the maastricht treaty of 1992 removed the word `` economic '' from the treaty of rome 's official title and , in 2009 , the treaty of lisbon renamed it the `` treaty on the functioning of the european union '' .

multilingualism is the use of more than one language , either by an individual speaker or by a group of speakers . it is believed that multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world 's population . more than half of all europeans claim to speak at least one language other than their mother tongue ; but many read and write in one language . always useful to traders , multilingualism is advantageous for people wanting to participate in globalization and cultural openness . owing to the ease of access to information facilitated by the internet , individuals ' exposure to multiple languages is becoming increasingly possible . people who speak several languages are also called polyglots.multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood , the so-called first language ( l1 ) . the first language ( sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue ) is acquired without formal education , by mechanisms about which scholars disagree . children acquiring two languages natively from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals . it is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other.people who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals.multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between internationalization and localization . due to the status of english in computing , software development nearly always uses it ( but see also non-english-based programming languages ) . some commercial software is initially available in an english version , and multilingual versions , if any , may be produced as alternative options based on the english original .

josquin des prez ( ; – 27 august 1521 ) , often referred to simply as josquin , was a french composer of the renaissance . he was the most famous european composer between guillaume dufay and giovanni pierluigi da palestrina , and is usually considered to be the central figure of the franco-flemish school . josquin is widely considered by music scholars to be the first master of the high renaissance style of polyphonic vocal music that was emerging during his lifetime.during the 16th century , josquin gradually acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age , his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired . writers as diverse as baldassare castiglione and martin luther wrote about his reputation and fame , with luther declaring that `` he is the master of the notes . they must do as he wills ; as for the other composers , they have to do as the notes will . '' theorists such as heinrich glarean and gioseffo zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection . he was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists , probably to increase their sales . more than 370 works are attributed to him ; it was only after the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these attributions were challenged , and revealed as mistaken , on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence . yet in spite of josquin 's colossal reputation , which endured until the beginning of the baroque era and was revived in the 20th century , his biography is shadowy , and virtually nothing is known about his personality . the only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito on the wall of the sistine chapel , and only one contemporary mention of his character is known , in a letter to duke ercole i of ferrara . the lives of dozens of less revered renaissance composers are better documented than that of josquin.josquin wrote both sacred and secular music , and in all of the significant vocal forms of the age , including masses , motets , chansons and frottole . during the 16th century , he was praised for both his supreme melodic gift and his use of ingenious technical devices . in modern times , scholars have attempted to ascertain the basic details of his biography , and have tried to define the key characteristics of his style to correct misattributions , a task that has proved difficult , as josquin liked to solve compositional problems in different ways in successive compositions—sometimes he wrote in an austere style devoid of ornamentation , and at other times he wrote music requiring considerable virtuosity . heinrich glarean wrote in 1547 that josquin was not only a `` magnificent virtuoso '' ( the latin can be translated also as `` show-off '' ) but capable of being a `` mocker '' , using satire effectively . while the focus of scholarship in recent years has been to remove music from the `` josquin canon '' ( including some of his most famous pieces ) and to reattribute it to his contemporaries , the remaining music represents some of the most famous and enduring of the renaissance .

methodism , also called the methodist movement , is a group of historically related denominations of protestant christianity which derive their doctrine of practice and belief from the life and teachings of john wesley . george whitefield and john 's brother charles wesley were also significant early leaders in the movement . it originated as a revival movement within the 18th-century church of england and became a separate denomination after wesley 's death . the movement spread throughout the british empire , the united states , and beyond because of vigorous missionary work , today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.wesleyan theology , which is upheld by the methodist churches , focuses on sanctification and the effect of faith on the character of a christian . distinguishing methodist doctrines include the new birth , assurance , imparted righteousness , the possibility of entire sanctification , the works of piety , and the primacy of scripture . most methodists teach that jesus christ , the son of god , died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all ; in theology , this view is known as arminianism . this teaching rejects the calvinist position that god has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people . however , whitefield and several other early leaders of the movement were considered calvinistic methodists and held to the calvinist position . in addition to evangelism , methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick , the poor , and the afflicted through the works of mercy . these ideals , collectively known as the social gospel , are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals , orphanages , soup kitchens , and schools to follow christ 's command to spread the good news and serve all people.the movement has a wide variety of forms of worship , ranging from high church to low church in liturgical usage . denominations that descend from the british methodist tradition are generally less ritualistic , while american methodism is more so , the united methodist church in particular . methodism is known for its rich musical tradition , and charles wesley was instrumental in writing much of the hymnody of the methodist church.early methodists were drawn from all levels of society , including the aristocracy , but the methodist preachers took the message to labourers and criminals who tended to be left outside organized religion at that time . in britain , the methodist church had a major effect in the early decades of the developing working class ( 1760–1820 ) . in the united states , it became the religion of many slaves who later formed black churches in the methodist tradition .

binomial nomenclature ( `` two-term naming system '' ) , also called nomenclature ( `` two-name naming system '' ) or binary nomenclature , is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts , both of which use latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages . such a name is called a binomial name ( which may be shortened to just `` binomial '' ) , a binomen , name or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a latin name.the first part of the name – the `` generic name '' – identifies the genus to which the species belongs , while the second part – the specific name or specific epithet – identifies the species within the genus . for example , humans belong to the genus `` homo '' and within this genus to the species `` homo sapiens '' . `` tyrannosaurus rex '' is probably the most widely known binomial . the `` formal '' introduction of this system of naming species is credited to carl linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work `` species plantarum '' in 1753 . but gaspard bauhin , in as early as 1622 , had introduced in his book `` pinax theatri botanici '' ( english , `` illustrated exposition of plants '' ) many names of genera that were later adopted by linnaeus.the application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules , of which the two most important are the `` international code of zoological nomenclature '' ( `` iczn '' ) for animals and the `` international code of nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants '' ( `` icnafp '' ) . although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes , there are some differences , both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.in modern usage , the first letter of the first part of the name , the genus , is always capitalized in writing , while that of the second part is not , even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place . similarly , both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text ( or underlined in handwriting ) . thus the binomial name of the annual phlox ( named after botanist thomas drummond ) is now written as `` phlox drummondii '' .in scientific works , the authority for a binomial name is usually given , at least when it is first mentioned , and the date of publication may be specified . 
tickling is the act of touching a part of a body in a way that causes involuntary twitching movements or laughter . the word evolved from the middle english `` tikelen '' , perhaps frequentative of `` ticken '' , to touch lightly.in 1897 , psychologists g. stanley hall and arthur allin described a `` tickle '' as two different types of phenomena . one type is caused by very light movement across the skin . this type of tickle , called a knismesis , generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation . 
the zapatista army of national liberation ( `` ejército zapatista de liberación nacional '' , ezln ) , often referred to as the zapatistas , is a far-left libertarian-socialist political and militant group that controls a substantial amount of territory in chiapas , the southernmost state of mexico.since 1994 the group has been nominally at war with the mexican state ( although it may be described at this point as a frozen conflict ) . in recent years , the ezln has focused on a strategy of civil resistance . the zapatistas ' main body is made up of mostly rural indigenous people , but it includes some supporters in urban areas and internationally . the ezln 's main spokesperson is subcomandante insurgente galeano , previously known as subcomandante marcos ( a.k.a . compañero galeano and delegate zero in relation to `` the other campaign '' ) . unlike other zapatista spokespeople , marcos is not an indigenous maya.the group takes its name from emiliano zapata , the agrarian revolutionary and commander of the liberation army of the south during the mexican revolution , and sees itself as his ideological heir . nearly all ezln villages contain murals with images of zapata , ernesto `` che '' guevara , and subcomandante marcos.while ezln ideology is similar to libertarian socialism , the zapatistas have rejected and defied political classification . the ezln aligns itself with the wider alter-globalization , anti-neoliberal social movement , seeking indigenous control over local resources , especially land . since their 1994 uprising was countered by the mexican armed forces , the ezln has abstained from military offensives and adopted a new strategy that attempts to garner mexican and international support .

metriacanthosauridae is an extinct family of theropod dinosaurs that lived from the middle jurassic to the early cretaceous . when broken down into its greek roots , it means `` moderately-spined lizards '' . the family is split into two subgroups : metriacanthosaurinae , which includes dinosaurs closely related to `` metriacanthosaurus '' , and another group composed of the close relatives of `` yangchuanosaurus '' . metriacanthosaurids are considered carnosaurs , belonging to the allosauroidea superfamily . the group includes species of large range in body size . of their physical traits , most notable are their neural spines . their fossils can be found mostly in the northern hemisphere . metriacanthosauridae is used as a senior synonym of sinraptoridae . 
the holarctic is the name for the biogeographic realm that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world , combining wallace 's palearctic zoogeographical region , consisting of north africa and all of eurasia ( with the exception of the southern arabian peninsula , southeast asia , and the indian subcontinent ) , and the nearctic zoogeographical region , consisting of north america , north of mexico . these regions are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions . many ecosystems , and the animal and plant communities that depend on them , are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm . the continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm . the floristic boreal kingdom corresponds to the holarctic realm . 
a binary image is one that consists of pixels that can have one of exactly two colors , usually black and white . binary images are also called `` bi-level '' or `` two-level '' . this means that each pixel is stored as a single bit—i.e. , a 0 or 1 . the names `` black-and-white '' , `` b & w '' , monochrome or monochromatic are often used for this concept , but may also designate any images that have only one sample per pixel , such as grayscale images . in photoshop parlance , a binary image is the same as an image in `` bitmap '' mode.binary images often arise in digital image processing as masks or thresholding , and dithering . some input/output devices , such as laser printers , fax machines , and bilevel computer displays , can only handle bilevel images.a binary image can be stored in memory as a bitmap , a packed array of bits . a 640×480 image requires 37.5 kib of storage . because of the small size of the image files , fax machine and document management solutions usually use this format . most binary images also compress well with simple run-length compression schemes.binary images can be interpreted as subsets of the two-dimensional integer lattice `` z '' ; the field of morphological image processing was largely inspired by this view .

a subsidiary alliance , in south asian history , describes a tributary alliance between a native state and either french india , or later the british east india company . the pioneer of the subsidiary alliance system was french governor joseph françois dupleix , who in the late 1740s established treaties with the nizam of hyderabad , and carnatic.the methodology was subsequently adopted by the east india company , with robert clive imposing a series of conditions on mir jafar of bengal , following the 1757 battle of plassey , and subsequently those in the 1765 treaty of allahabad , as a result of the company 's success in the 1764 battle of buxar . a successor of clive , richard wellesley initially took a non-interventionist policy towards the native states but later adopted , and refined the policy of forming subsidiary alliances . the purpose and ambition of this change are stated in his february 1804 dispatch to the east india company resident in hyderabad : his excellency the governor-general 's policy in establishing subsidiary alliances with the principal states of india is to place those states in such a degree of dependence on the british power as may deprive them of the means of prosecuting any measures or of forming any confederacy hazardous to the security of the british empire , and may enable us to reserve the tranquility of india by exercising a general control over those states , calculated to prevent the operation of that restless spirit of ambition and violence which is the characteristic of every asiatic government , and which from the earliest period of eastern history has rendered the peninsula of india the scene of perpetual warfare , turbulence and disorder ... richard wellesley , 4th february 1804in a subsidiary alliance , princely rulers were not allowed to make any negotiations and treaty with any other ruler . they were also not allowed to have an independent armed force . they were to be protected by the east india company but had to pay for the subsidiary forces that the company was to maintain for protection . if indian rulers failed to make the payment , part of their territory was taken away as penalty . for example , the nawab ( ruler ) of awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the company in 1801 , reason provided by british officer was maladministration . hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds.by the late 18th century , the power of the maratha empire had weakened and the indian subcontinent was left with a great number of states , most small and weak . many rulers accepted the offer of protection by wellesley , as it gave them security against attack by their neighbours . the alliance was forced upon rulers so their territories could be annexed by the british .

the commonwealth chair-in-office ( cio ) is the chair-in-office of the commonwealth of nations , and is one of the main leadership positions in the commonwealth . it is held by the host chairperson of the previous commonwealth heads of government meeting ( chogm ) , and is maintained until the next chogm.the primary responsibility of the chair-in-office is to host the chogm , but their roles can be expanded . for example , after the 2002 chogm , the incumbent , previous , and next chairmen-in-office formed a troika in an attempt to resolve the ongoing dispute over zimbabwe 's membership of the commonwealth.the position was created after the 1999 chogm , with thabo mbeki becoming the first chair-in-office . however , mbeki did very little to develop the position , leaving it virtually vacant until the next chogm in 2002 , when the troika was created . even after john howard became chair , the troika 's first meeting was in london , in the presence of the commonwealth secretary-general . the third chair , olusegun obasanjo , did more to invigorate the role of the position after taking over in 2003.since the assumption of the role at the 2009 chogm , representatives from trinidad and tobago , including the prime ministers , have attended commonwealth meetings , including 2011 commonwealth day celebrations where kamla persad-bissessar , the first woman to chair the commonwealth , gave the keynote address . sri lanka was due to host the commonwealth economic forum in 2011 but it was held instead in perth , australia due to accusations of alleged war crimes committed during the sri lankan civil war.as prime minister of australia , julia gillard succeeded persad-bissessar as the second female chair at the 2011 chogm . julia gillard was in-turn succeeded by kevin rudd after she resigned as prime minister of australia on 27 june 2013 . rudd went on to lose the australian federal election in september 2013 , and consequently was succeeded as ccio by the new prime minister tony abbott . abbott remained in the position until commonwealth leaders met for the 23rd time on 15 november 2013 , where he was succeeded by the president of sri lanka mahinda rajapaksa , who was succeeded by maithripala sirisena in 2015 . 
the genesis creation narrative is the creation myth of both judaism and christianity . the narrative is made up of two stories , roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the book of genesis . in the first , elohim ( the hebrew generic word for god ) creates the heavens and the earth in six days , then rests on , blesses and sanctifies the seventh ( i.e . the biblical sabbath ) . in the second story , god , now referred to by the personal name yahweh , creates adam , the first man , from dust and places him in the garden of eden , where he is given dominion over the animals . eve , the first woman , is created from adam and as his companion.borrowing themes from mesopotamian mythology , but adapting them to the israelite people 's belief in one god , the first major comprehensive draft of the pentateuch ( the series of five books which begins with genesis and ends with deuteronomy ) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century bce ( the jahwist source ) and was later expanded by other authors ( the priestly source ) into a work very like genesis as known today . the two sources can be identified in the creation narrative : priestly and jahwistic . the combined narrative is a critique of the mesopotamian theology of creation : genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism . robert alter described the combined narrative as `` compelling in its archetypal character , its adaptation of myth to monotheistic ends '' .misunderstanding the genre of the genesis creation narrative , meaning the intention of the author ( s ) and the culture within which they wrote , can result in misreadings of the myth as history . this has inspired some believers to promote creationism and deny evolution . as scholar of jewish studies , jon d. levenson , puts it :

a battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces . a war usually consists of multiple battles . in general , a battle is a military engagement that is well defined in duration , area , and force commitment . an engagement with only limited commitment between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a skirmish.wars and military campaigns are guided by strategy , whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility . german strategist carl von clausewitz stated that `` the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war '' was the essence of strategy . 
tabebuia is a genus of flowering plants in the family bignoniaceae . the common name `` roble '' is sometimes found in english . `` tabebuias '' have been called `` trumpet trees '' , but this name is usually applied to other trees and has become a source of confusion and misidentification . `` tabebuia '' consists almost entirely of trees , but a few are often large shrubs . a few species produce timber , but the genus is mostly known for those that are cultivated as flowering trees . `` tabebuia '' is native to the american tropics and subtropics from mexico and the caribbean to argentina . most of the species are from cuba and hispaniola . it is commonly cultivated and often naturalized or adventive beyond its natural range . it easily escapes cultivation because of its numerous , wind-borne seeds.in 1992 , a revision of `` tabebuia '' described 99 species and one hybrid . phylogenetic studies of dna sequences later showed that `` tabebuia '' , as then circumscribed , was polyphyletic . in 2007 , it was divided into three separate genera . primavera ( `` roseodendron donnell-smithii '' ) and a related species with no unique common name ( `` roseodendron chryseum '' ) were transferred to `` roseodendron '' . those species known as `` ipê '' and `` pau d'arco '' ( in portuguese ) or poui were transferred to `` handroanthus '' . sixty-seven species remained in `` tabebuia '' . the former genus and polyphyletic group of 99 species described by gentry in 1992 is now usually referred to as `` '' tabebuia '' sensu lato '' .

deptford is an area of south-east london , england . it is on the south bank of the river thames , and within the london borough of lewisham . it is named after a ford of the river ravensbourne . from the mid 16th century to the late 19th it was home to deptford dockyard , the first of the royal dockyards . this was a major shipbuilding dock and attracted peter the great to come and study shipbuilding . deptford and the docks are associated with the knighting of sir francis drake by queen elizabeth i aboard the golden hind , the legend of sir walter raleigh laying down his cape for elizabeth , captain james cook 's third voyage aboard resolution , and the mysterious murder of christopher marlowe in a house along deptford strand.though deptford began as two small communities , one at the ford , and the other a fishing village on the thames , deptford 's history and population has been mainly associated with the docks established by henry viii . the two communities grew together and flourished ; the docks were the main administrative centre of the royal navy , and some grand houses like sayes court , home to diarist john evelyn , and stone house on lewisham way , were erected . the area declined as first the royal navy moved out , and then the commercial docks themselves declined until the last dock , convoys wharf , closed in 2000.a metropolitan borough of deptford existed from 1900 until 1965 , when the area became part of the newly-created london borough of lewisham . 
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) ( , ) is a commonly used analytical biochemistry assay , first described by engvall and perlmann in 1971 . the assay uses a solid-phase type of enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) to detect the presence of a ligand ( commonly a protein ) in a liquid sample using antibodies directed against the protein to be measured . elisa has been used as a diagnostic tool in medicine , plant pathology , and biotechnology , as well as a quality control check in various industries.in the most simple form of an elisa , antigens from the sample to be tested are attached to a surface . then , a matching antibody is applied over the surface so it can bind the antigen . this antibody is linked to an enzyme and then any unbound antibodies are removed . in the final step , a substance containing the enzyme 's substrate is added . if there was binding the subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal , most commonly a color change.performing an elisa involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen . the sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on a solid support ( usually a polystyrene microtiter plate ) either non-specifically ( via adsorption to the surface ) or specifically ( via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen , in a `` sandwich '' elisa ) . after the antigen is immobilized , the detection antibody is added , forming a complex with the antigen . the detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme or can itself be detected by a secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme through bioconjugation . between each step , the plate is typically washed with a mild detergent solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound . after the final wash step , the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic substrate to produce a visible signal , which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.of note , elisa can perform other forms of ligand binding assays instead of strictly `` immuno '' assays , though the name carried the original `` immuno '' because of the common use and history of development of this method . the technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified . in between the washes , only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or `` immunosorbed '' by antigen-antibody interactions to the solid phase , while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away . unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well ( e.g. , a cuvette ) can be reused after washing , the elisa plates have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase , which is part of the plate , and so are not easily reusable . 
rna interference ( rnai ) is a biological process in which rna molecules inhibit gene expression or translation , by neutralizing targeted mrna molecules . historically , rnai was known by other names , including `` co-suppression '' , `` post-transcriptional gene silencing '' ( ptgs ) , and `` quelling '' . the detailed study of each of these seemingly different processes elucidated that the identity of these phenomena were all actually rnai . andrew fire and craig c. mello shared the 2006 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work on rna interference in the nematode worm `` caenorhabditis elegans '' , which they published in 1998 . since the discovery of rnai and its regulatory potentials , it has become evident that rnai has immense potential in suppression of desired genes . rnai is now known as precise , efficient , stable and better than antisense therapy for gene suppression . however , antisense rna produced intracellularly by an expression vector may be developed and find utility as novel therapeutic agents.two types of small ribonucleic acid ( rna ) molecules – microrna ( mirna ) and small interfering rna ( sirna ) – are central to rna interference . rnas are the direct products of genes , and these small rnas can direct enzyme complexes to degrade messenger rna ( mrna ) molecules and thus decrease their activity by preventing translation , via post-transcriptional gene silencing . moreover , transcription can be inhibited via the pre-transcriptional silencing mechanism of rna interference , through which an enzyme complex catalyzes dna methylation at genomic positions complementary to complexed sirna or mirna . rna interference has an important role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences – viruses and transposons . it also influences development.the rnai pathway is found in many eukaryotes , including animals , and is initiated by the enzyme dicer , which cleaves long double-stranded rna ( dsrna ) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~21 nucleotide sirnas . each sirna is unwound into two single-stranded rnas ( ssrnas ) , the passenger strand and the guide strand . the passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex ( risc ) . the most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing , which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger rna molecule and induces cleavage by argonaute 2 ( ago2 ) , the catalytic component of the risc . in some organisms , this process spreads systemically , despite the initially limited molar concentrations of sirna.rnai is a valuable research tool , both in cell culture and in living organisms , because synthetic dsrna introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest . rnai may be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell , which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division . the pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology , medicine and insecticides . 
little nicky ( born october 17 , 2004 ) is the first commercially produced cat clone . he was produced from the dna of a 17-year-old maine coon cat named nicky who died in 2003 . little nicky 's owner , a north texas woman named julie ( whose last name was not released ) paid $ 50,000 to have nicky cloned . little nicky 's owner reported that the cat shared many characteristics with his predecessor , including a similar personality and appearance .

woodturning is the craft of using the wood lathe with hand-held tools to cut a shape that is symmetrical around the axis of rotation . like the potter 's wheel , the wood lathe is a simple mechanism which can generate a variety of forms . the operator is known as a turner , and the skills needed to use the tools were traditionally known as turnery . in pre-industrial england , these skills were sufficiently difficult to be known as 'the misterie ' of the turners guild . the skills to use the tools by hand , without a fixed point of contact with the wood , distinguish woodturning and the wood lathe from the machinists lathe , or metal-working lathe.items made on the lathe include tool handles , candlesticks , egg cups , knobs , lamps , rolling pins , cylindrical boxes , christmas ornaments , bodkins , knitting needles , needle cases , thimbles , pens , chessmen , spinning tops ; legs , spindles and pegs for furniture ; balusters and newel posts for architecture ; baseball bats , hollow forms such as woodwind musical instruments , urns , sculptures ; bowls , platters , and chair seats . industrial production has replaced many of these products from the traditional turning shop . however , the wood lathe is still used for decentralized production of limited or custom turnings . a skilled turner can produce a wide variety of objects with five or six simple tools . the tools can be reshaped easily for the task at hand.in many parts of the world , the lathe has been a portable tool that goes to the source of the wood , or adapts to temporary workspaces . 21st-century turners restore furniture , continue folk-art traditions , produce custom architectural work , and create fine craft for galleries . woodturning appeals to people who like to work with their hands , find pleasure in problem-solving , or enjoy the tactile and visual qualities of wood . 
the dole effect , named after malcolm dole , describes an inequality in the ratio of the heavy isotope o ( a `` standard '' oxygen atom with two additional neutrons ) to the lighter o , measured in the atmosphere and seawater . this ratio is usually denoted δo.it was noticed in 1935 that air contained more o than seawater ; this was quantified in 1975 to 23.5‰ , but later refined as 23.88‰ in 2005 . the imbalance arises mainly as a result of respiration in plants and in animals . due to thermodynamics of isotope reactions , respiration removes the lighter — hence more reactive — o in preference to o , increasing the relative amount of o in the atmosphere.the inequality is balanced by photosynthesis . photosynthesis emits oxygen with the same isotopic composition ( i.e . the ratio between o and o ) as the water ( ho ) used in the reaction , which is independent of the atmospheric ratio . thus when atmospheric o levels are high enough , photosynthesis will act as a reducing factor . however , as a complicating factor , the degree of fractionation ( i.e . change in isotope ratio ) occurring due to photosynthesis is not `` entirely '' dependent on the water drawn up by the plant , as fractionation can occur as a result of preferential evaporation of and other small but significant processes . 
hamilton hume ( 19 june 1797 – 19 april 1873 ) was an early explorer of the present-day australian states of new south wales and victoria . in 1824 , along with william hovell , hume participated in an expedition that first took an overland route from sydney to port phillip ( near the site of present-day melbourne ) . along with sturt in 1828 , he was part of an expedition of the first europeans to find the darling river . 
henry vi ( 6 december 1421 – 21 may 1471 ) was king of england from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471 , and disputed king of france from 1422 to 1453 . the only child of henry v , he succeeded to the english throne at the age of nine months upon his father 's death , and succeeded to the french throne on the death of his maternal grandfather , charles vi , shortly afterwards.henry inherited the long-running hundred years ' war ( 1337–1453 ) , in which his uncle charles vii contested his claim to the french throne . he is the only english monarch to also have been crowned king of france ( as henry ii , in 1431 ) . his early reign , when several people were ruling for him , saw the pinnacle of english power in france , but subsequent military , diplomatic , and economic problems had seriously endangered the english cause by the time henry was declared fit to rule in 1437 . he found his realm in a difficult position , faced with setbacks in france and divisions among the nobility at home . unlike his father , henry is described as timid , shy , passive , well-intentioned , and averse to warfare and violence ; he was also at times mentally unstable . his ineffective reign saw the gradual loss of the english lands in france . partially in the hope of achieving peace , in 1445 henry married charles vii 's niece , the ambitious and strong-willed margaret of anjou . the peace policy failed , leading to the murder of one of henry 's key advisers , william de la pole , 1st duke of suffolk , and the war recommenced , with france taking the upper hand ; by 1453 , calais was henry 's only remaining territory on the continent.as the situation in france worsened , there was a related increase in political instability in england . with henry effectively unfit to rule , power was exercised by quarrelsome nobles , while factions and favourites encouraged the rise of disorder in the country . regional magnates and soldiers returning from france formed and maintained increasing numbers of private armed retainers , with whom they fought one another , terrorised their neighbours , paralysed the courts , and dominated the government . queen margaret did not remain unpartisan , and took advantage of the situation to make herself an effective power behind the throne.amidst military disasters in france and a collapse of law and order in england , the queen and her clique came under accusations , especially from henry vi 's increasingly popular cousin richard , duke of york , of misconduct of the war in france and misrule of the country . starting in 1453 , henry had a series of mental breakdowns , and tensions mounted between margaret and richard of york over control of the incapacitated king 's government , and over the question of succession to the english throne . civil war broke out in 1455 , leading to a long period of dynastic conflict known as the wars of the roses . henry was deposed on 29 march 1461 after a crushing defeat at the battle of towton by richard 's son , who took the throne as edward iv . despite margaret continuing to lead a resistance to edward , henry was captured by edward 's forces in 1465 and imprisoned in the tower of london . henry was restored to the throne in 1470 , but edward retook power in 1471 , killing henry 's only son and heir , edward of westminster , in battle and imprisoning henry once again.having `` lost his wits , his two kingdoms , and his only son '' , henry died in the tower during the night of 21 may , possibly killed on the orders of king edward . miracles were attributed to henry after his death , and he was informally regarded as a saint and martyr until the 16th century . he left a legacy of educational institutions , having founded eton college , king 's college , cambridge , and ( together with henry chichele ) all souls college , oxford . shakespeare wrote a trilogy of plays about his life , depicting him as weak-willed and easily influenced by his wife , margaret .

the new england town , generally referred to in new england simply as a town , is the basic unit of local government and local division of state authority in each of the six new england states and without a direct counterpart in most other u.s. states . new england towns overlay the entire area of a state , similar to civil townships in other states where they exist , but they are fully functioning municipal corporations , possessing powers similar to cities in other states . new jersey 's system of equally powerful townships , boroughs , towns , and cities is the system which is most similar to that of new england . new england towns are often governed by a town meeting legislative body . the great majority of municipal corporations in new england are based on the town model ; statutory forms based on the concept of a compact populated place are uncommon , though they are prevalent elsewhere in the u.s. county government in new england states is typically weak at best , and in some states nonexistent . connecticut , for example , has no county governments , nor does rhode island . both of those states retain counties only as geographic subdivisions with no governmental authority , while massachusetts has abolished eight of fourteen county governments so far . with few exceptions , counties serve mostly as dividing lines for the states ' judicial systems .

kenneth anger ( born kenneth wilbur anglemyer , february 3 , 1927 ) is an american underground experimental filmmaker , actor , and author . working exclusively in short films , he has produced almost forty works since 1937 , nine of which have been grouped together as the `` magick lantern cycle '' . his films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult , and have been described as containing `` elements of erotica , documentary , psychodrama , and spectacle '' . anger himself has been described as `` one of america 's first openly gay filmmakers , and certainly the first whose work addressed homosexuality in an undisguised , self-implicating manner '' , and his `` role in rendering gay culture visible within american cinema , commercial or otherwise , is impossible to overestimate '' , with several being released prior to the legalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults in the united states . he has also focused upon occult themes in many of his films , being fascinated by the english gnostic mage and poet aleister crowley , and is an adherent of thelema , the religion crowley founded.born to a middle-class family in santa monica , california , anger would later claim to have been a child actor who appeared in the film `` a midsummer night 's dream '' ( 1935 ) ; the accuracy of this claim has come under dispute . he began making short films when he was ten years old , although his first film to gain any recognition , the homoerotic `` fireworks '' ( 1947 ) , would only be produced a decade later . the controversial nature of the work led to him being put on trial on obscenity charges , but he was acquitted . a friendship and working relationship began subsequently with pioneering sexologist alfred kinsey . moving to europe , anger produced a number of other shorts inspired by the artistic avant-garde scene on the continent , such as `` rabbit 's moon '' ( released 1971 ) and `` eaux d'artifice '' ( 1953 ) .returning to the united states in 1953 , he set about working on several new projects , including the films `` inauguration of the pleasure dome '' ( 1954 ) , `` scorpio rising '' ( 1964 ) , `` kustom kar kommandos '' ( 1965 ) , and the gossip book `` hollywood babylon '' ( 1965 ) . the latter would become infamous for its many dubious and sensationalist claims , many of which were later disproven , though some do remain as urban legends . getting to know several notable countercultural figures of the time , including tennessee williams , mick jagger , keith richards , jimmy page , marianne faithfull and anton lavey , anger involved them in his subsequent thelemite-themed works , `` invocation of my demon brother '' ( 1969 ) and `` lucifer rising '' ( 1972 ) . following his failure to produce a sequel to `` lucifer rising '' , which he attempted through the mid-1980s , anger retired from filmmaking , instead focusing on `` hollywood babylon ii '' ( 1984 ) . at the dawn of the 21st century he once more returned to filmmaking , producing shorts for various film festivals and events.anger has described filmmakers such as auguste and louis lumière , georges méliès , and maya deren as influences , and has been cited as an important influence on later film directors like martin scorsese , david lynch and john waters . he has also been described as having `` a profound impact on the work of many other filmmakers and artists , as well as on music video as an emergent art form using dream sequence , dance , fantasy , and narrative '' .

the petroleum industry , also known as the oil industry or the oil patch , includes the global processes of exploration , extraction , refining , transporting ( often by oil tankers and pipelines ) , and marketing of petroleum products . the largest volume products of the industry are fuel oil and gasoline ( petrol ) . petroleum ( oil ) is also the raw material for many chemical products , including pharmaceuticals , solvents , fertilizers , pesticides , synthetic fragrances , and plastics . the extreme monetary value of oil and its products has led to it being known as `` black gold '' . the industry is usually divided into three major components : upstream , midstream , and downstream . upstream deals with drilling and production mainly.petroleum is vital to many industries , and is necessary for the maintenance of industrial civilization in its current configuration , making it a critical concern for many nations . oil accounts for a large percentage of the world’s energy consumption , ranging from a low of 32 % for europe and asia , to a high of 53 % for the middle east.other geographic regions ' consumption patterns are as follows : south and central america ( 44 % ) , africa ( 41 % ) , and north america ( 40 % ) . the world consumes 30 billion barrels ( 4.8 km³ ) of oil per year , with developed nations being the largest consumers . the united states consumed 25 % of the oil produced in 2007 . the production , distribution , refining , and retailing of petroleum taken as a whole represents the world 's largest industry in terms of dollar value.governments such as the united states government provide a heavy public subsidy to petroleum companies , with major tax breaks at virtually every stage of oil exploration and extraction , including the costs of oil field leases and drilling equipment.in recent years , enhanced oil recovery techniques — most notably multi-stage drilling and hydraulic fracturing ( `` fracking '' ) — have moved to the forefront of the industry as this new technology plays a crucial and controversial role in new methods of oil extraction . 
softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball ( 11 to 16 in . circumference ) on a field that has base lengths of 60 feet , a pitcher 's mound that ranges from 43–50 feet away from home plate , and a home run fence that is 220–300 feet away from home plate , depending on the type of softball being played . it was invented in 1887 in chicago , illinois , united states as an indoor game . the game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball . there is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball ; yet , the fielder has less time to field the ball while the opponent is running down to first base . the name `` softball '' was given to the game in 1926 , because the ball used to be soft ; however , in modern-day usage , the balls are hard.a tournament held in 1933 at the chicago world 's fair spurred interest in the game . the amateur softball association ( asa ) of america ( founded 1933 ) is one of the largest governing bodies for the game in the united states and sponsors annual sectional and world series championships . other national and regional governing bodies also exist , including the usssa . the world baseball softball confederation ( wbsc ) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries , including the united states and canada ; before the wbsc was formed in 2013 , the international softball federation filled this role . women 's fast pitch softball became a summer olympic sport in 1996 , but it and baseball were dropped from the 2012 program ; they were to be reinstated in 2020 but the 2020 olympics were delayed due to the covid-19 international pandemic.there are two rules codes for softball generally . in the most common type , slow-pitch softball , the ball , which can measure either 11 inches , for a women 's league , or 12 inches , for a men 's league , in circumference , must arch on its path to the batter , and there are 10 players on the field at once . bunting and stealing bases are not permitted . in fast pitch softball , the pitch is fast , there are nine players on the field at one time , and while bunting and stealing bases are permitted , leading off is not . fast pitch being the most common in some states , such as virginia , where fast pitch is the most common type of softball in high schools across the state . the olympics features women 's fast pitch softball . softball rules vary somewhat from those of baseball . two major differences are that the ball must be pitched underhand—from 50 ft ( 15.2 m ) in slow pitch , or 46/43 ft ( 14/13.1 m ) for men/women in fast pitch as compared with 60.5 ft ( 18.4 m ) in baseball—and that seven innings , or 1-2 hours depending on the league , constitute a regulation game compared with nine innings in baseball.despite the name , the ball used in softball is not soft , unless using a foam practice softball . it is about 12 in ( about 30 cm ) in circumference ( 11 or 12 in for slow-pitch ) , which is 3 in ( 8 cm ) larger than a baseball . softball recreational leagues for children use 11-inch balls until around age 13 . the infield in softball is smaller than on an adult or high school baseball diamond but identical to that used by little league baseball ; each base is 60 ft ( 18 m ) from the next , as opposed to baseball 's 90 ft ( 27 m ) . in fast pitch softball the entire infield is dirt , whereas the infield in baseball is grass except at the bases and on the pitcher 's mound which are dirt . softball mounds are also flat , while baseball mounds are a small hill . softballs are pitched underhand , but baseballs are pitched overhand . this changes the arc of the ball when approaching the plate . for example , depending if the pitcher pitches a fastball , in softball the ball would most likely rise while in baseball because the pitcher is on a hill , the ball would drop .

speciesism ( ) or specism refers to the differing treatment or moral consideration of individuals based on their species membership . such discrimination involves treating members of one species as morally more important than members of other species , despite the individuals having similar interests.the term first appeared during a protest against animal experimentation in 1970 . philosophers such as peter singer argue that speciesism plays a role in the practice of factory farming , the use of animals for entertainment such as in bullfighting and rodeos , the taking of animals ' fur and skin , experimentation on animals . others , including oscar horta , argue that the refusal to aid animals suffering in the wild due to natural processes , is a form of speciesism.singer and other philosophers assert that speciesism only occurs when the interests of different beings are similar . they argue that it does not apply when there is a reason for giving greater consideration to a member of one species over another , such as having certain capacities like consciousness and the ability to experience suffering , or having differing interests ; for example , a pig does not have an interest in freedom of speech , but many humans do . conversely , it would be speciesist to regard killing a severely mentally disabled human as morally worse than killing an animal if their interests are similar.the ethics , morality , and concept of speciesism has been the subject of substantial philosophical debate .

big data is a field that treats ways to analyze , systematically extract information from , or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software . data with many cases ( rows ) offer greater statistical power , while data with higher complexity ( more attributes or columns ) may lead to a higher false discovery rate . big data challenges include capturing data , data storage , data analysis , search , sharing , transfer , visualization , querying , updating , information privacy and data source . big data was originally associated with three key concepts : `` volume '' , `` variety '' , and `` velocity '' . when we handle big data , we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens . therefore , big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and `` value . `` current usage of the term `` big data '' tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics , user behavior analytics , or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data , and seldom to a particular size of data set . `` there is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large , but that 's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem . `` analysis of data sets can find new correlations to `` spot business trends , prevent diseases , combat crime and so on . '' scientists , business executives , practitioners of medicine , advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including internet searches , fintech , urban informatics , and business informatics . scientists encounter limitations in e-science work , including meteorology , genomics , connectomics , complex physics simulations , biology and environmental research.data sets grow rapidly , to a certain extent because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing internet of things devices such as mobile devices , aerial ( remote sensing ) , software logs , cameras , microphones , radio-frequency identification ( rfid ) readers and wireless sensor networks . the world 's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s ; , every day 2.5 exabytes ( 2.5×2 bytes ) of data are generated . based on an idc report prediction , the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020 . by 2025 , idc predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data . one question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.relational database management systems , desktop statistics and software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty handling big data . the work may require `` massively parallel software running on tens , hundreds , or even thousands of servers '' . what qualifies as being `` big data '' varies depending on the capabilities of the users and their tools , and expanding capabilities make big data a moving target . `` for some organizations , facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options . for others , it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration .

eurocentrism ( also eurocentricity or western-centrism ) is a worldview that is centered on western civilization or a biased view that favors it over non-western civilizations . the exact scope of centrism varies from the entire western world to just the continent of europe or even more narrowly , to western europe ( especially during the cold war ) . when the term is applied to history , it may be used in reference to an apologetic stance towards european colonialism and other forms of imperialism.the term `` eurocentrism '' dates back to the late 1970s but it did not become prevalent until the 1990s , when it was frequently applied in the context of decolonization and development and humanitarian aid that industrialised ( first world ) countries offered to developing ( third world ) countries . 
the 4th century ( per the julian calendar and anno domini/common era ) was the time period which lasted from 301 to 400 . in the west , the early part of the century was shaped by constantine the great , who became the first roman emperor to adopt christianity . gaining sole reign of the empire , he is also noted for re-establishing a single imperial capital , choosing the site of ancient byzantium in 330 ( over the current capitals , which had effectively been changed by diocletian 's reforms to milan in the west , and nicomedeia in the east ) to build the city soon called nova roma ( new rome ) ; it was later renamed constantinople in his honor.the last emperor to control both the eastern and western halves of the empire was theodosius i . as the century progressed after his death it became increasingly apparent that the empire had changed in many ways since the time of augustus . the two emperor system originally established by diocletian in the previous century fell into regular practice , and the east continued to grow in importance as a centre of trade and imperial power , while rome itself diminished greatly in importance due to its location far from potential trouble spots , like central europe and the east . late in the century christianity became the official state religion , and the empire 's old pagan culture began to disappear . general prosperity was felt throughout this period , but recurring invasions by germanic tribes plagued the empire from 376 ad onward . these early invasions marked the beginning of the end for the western roman empire.in china , the jin dynasty , which had united the nation prior in 280 , began to quickly face troubles by the start of the century due to political infighting , which led to the opportunistic insurrections of the northern barbarian tribes ( starting the sixteen kingdoms period ) , which quickly overwhelmed the empire , forcing the jin court to retreat and entrench itself in the south past the yangtze river , starting what is known as the eastern jin dynasty around 317.towards the end of the century , emperor of the former qin , fu jiān , united the north under his banner , and planned to conquer the jin dynasty in the south , so as to finally reunite the land , but was decisively defeated at the battle of fei river in 383 , causing massive unrest and civil war in his empire , thereby leading to the fall of the former qin , and the continued existence of the eastern jin dynasty.according to archaeologists , sufficient archaeological correlates of state-level societies coalesced in the 4th century to show the existence in korea of the three kingdoms ( 300/400–668 ad ) of baekje , goguryeo , and silla .

in signal processing and statistics , a window function ( also known as an apodization function or tapering function ) is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval , normally symmetric around the middle of the interval , usually near a maximum in the middle , and usually tapering away from the middle . mathematically , when another function or waveform/data-sequence is `` multiplied '' by a window function , the product is also zero-valued outside the interval : all that is left is the part where they overlap , the `` view through the window '' . equivalently , and in actual practice , the segment of data within the window is first isolated , and then only that data is multiplied by the window function values . thus , tapering , not segmentation , is the main purpose of window functions.the reasons for examining segments of a longer function include detection of transient events and time-averaging of frequency spectra . the duration of the segments is determined in each application by requirements like time and frequency resolution . but that method also changes the frequency content of the signal by an effect called spectral leakage . window functions allow us to distribute the leakage spectrally in different ways , according to the needs of the particular application . there are many choices detailed in this article , but many of the differences are so subtle as to be insignificant in practice.in typical applications , the window functions used are non-negative , smooth , `` bell-shaped '' curves . rectangle , triangle , and other functions can also be used . a rectangular window does not modify the data segment at all . it 's only for modelling purposes that we say it multiplies by 1 inside the window and by 0 outside . a more general definition of window functions does not require them to be identically zero outside an interval , as long as the product of the window multiplied by its argument is square integrable , and , more specifically , that the function goes sufficiently rapidly toward zero .

korematsu v. united states , 323 u.s. 214 ( 1944 ) , was a landmark united states supreme court case upholding the exclusion of japanese americans from the west coast military area during world war ii . the decision has widely been criticized , with some scholars describing it as `` an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry '' and as `` a stain on american jurisprudence '' . chief justice john roberts wrote in his majority opinion in the 2018 case of `` trump v. hawaii '' that the `` korematsu '' decision was explicitly repudiated.in the aftermath of imperial japan 's attack on pearl harbor , president franklin d. roosevelt had issued executive order 9066 on february 19 , 1942 , authorizing the war department to create military areas from which any or all americans might be excluded . subsequently , the western defense command , a united states army military command charged with coordinating the defense of the west coast of the united states , ordered `` all persons of japanese ancestry , including aliens and non-aliens '' to relocate to internment camps . however , a 23-year-old japanese-american man , fred korematsu , refused to leave the exclusion zone and instead challenged the order on the grounds that it violated the fifth amendment.in a majority opinion joined by five other justices , associate justice hugo black held that the need to protect against espionage by japan outweighed the rights of americans of japanese descent . black wrote that : `` korematsu was not excluded from the military area because of hostility to him or his race '' , but rather `` because the properly constituted military authorities ... decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of japanese ancestry be segregated from the west coast '' during the war against japan . dissenting justices frank murphy , robert h. jackson , and owen j. roberts all criticized the exclusion as racially discriminatory ; murphy wrote that the exclusion of japanese `` falls into the ugly abyss of racism '' and resembled `` the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy . `` the `` korematsu '' opinion was the first instance in which the supreme court applied the strict scrutiny standard of review to racial discrimination by the government ; it is one of only a handful of cases in which the court held that the government met that standard . korematsu 's conviction was voided by a california district court in 1983 on the grounds that solicitor general charles h. fahy had suppressed a report from the office of naval intelligence that held that there was no evidence that japanese americans were acting as spies for japan . the japanese-americans who were interned were later granted reparations through the civil liberties act of 1988 .

a haplotype ( haploid genotype ) is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent . however , there are other uses of this term . first , it is used to mean a collection of specific alleles ( that is , specific dna sequences ) in a cluster of tightly linked genes on a chromosome that are likely to be inherited together—that is , they are likely to be conserved as a sequence that survives the descent of many generations of reproduction . a second use is to mean a set of linked single-nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) alleles that tend to always occur together ( i.e. , that are associated statistically ) . it is thought that identifying these statistical associations and a few alleles of a specific haplotype sequence can facilitate identifying `` all other such '' polymorphic sites that are nearby on the chromosome . such information is critical for investigating the genetics of common diseases ; which in fact have been investigated in humans by the international hapmap project . thirdly , many human genetic testing companies use the term in a third way : to refer to an individual collection of specific mutations within a given genetic segment ; ( see short tandem repeat mutation ) .the term 'haplogroup ' refers to the snp/unique-event polymorphism ( uep ) mutations that represent the clade to which a collection of particular human haplotypes belong . ( clade here refers to a set of haplotypes sharing a common ancestor . ) a haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation . mitochondrial dna passes along a maternal lineage that can date back thousands of years .

afrotheria ( from latin `` afro- '' `` of africa '' + `` theria '' `` wild beast '' ) is a clade of mammals , the living members of which belong to groups that are either currently living in africa or of african origin : golden moles , elephant shrews ( also known as sengis ) , tenrecs , aardvarks , hyraxes , elephants , sea cows , and several extinct clades . most groups of afrotheres share little or no superficial resemblance , and their similarities have only become known in recent times because of genetics and molecular studies . many afrothere groups are found mostly or exclusively in africa , reflecting the fact that africa was an island continent from the early cenozoic until around 25 million years ago , when the tethys sea shrank.because africa was isolated by water , laurasian groups of mammals such as insectivores , rodents , lagomorphs , carnivorans and ungulates could not reach africa for much of the early to mid-cenozoic . instead , the niches occupied by those groups on the northern continents were filled by various groups of afrotheres via the process of convergent evolution . the small insectivorous afrotheres such as elephant shrews , golden moles , and tenrecs filled the niches of insectivores , the hyraxes filled the roles of rodents and lagomorphs , the aardvarks filled the roles of various medium size ant-eating mammals ( anteaters , armadillos , pangolins , echidnas , numbats , etc . ) found on other continents throughout the cenozoic , and proboscideans ( elephants and their relatives ) filled the roles of large herbivores such as hippos and rhinos . the sirenians quickly became aquatic and started spreading to other parts of the world by water , evolving convergently with the other groups of marine mammals . in addition to their similarity with laurasian mammals in north america , europe , and asia , many afrotheres also exhibit convergent evolution with groups of mammals that evolved and lived exclusively in south america , which was also an island continent for much of the cenozoic.the common ancestry of these animals was not recognized until the late 1990s . historically , the paenungulata had been linked to other ungulates ; the golden mole , tenrecs , and elephant shrews with the traditional ( and polyphyletic ) insectivora ; and the aardvarks with the pangolins and the xenarthrans within the invalid taxon edentata . continuing work on the molecular and morphological diversity of afrotherian mammals has provided ever increasing support for their common ancestry .

a hedge fund is an investment fund that trades in relatively liquid assets and is able to make extensive use of more complex trading , portfolio-construction and risk management techniques to improve performance , such as short selling , leverage , and derivatives . because of its use of complex techniques , financial regulators typically do not allow hedge funds to be marketed or made available to anyone except institutional investors , high net worth individuals and other investors who are considered sufficiently sophisticated , such as being an accredited investor.hedge funds are regarded as alternative investments . their ability to make more extensive use of leverage and more complex investment techniques distinguishes them from regulated investment funds available to the retail market , such as us mutual funds and ucits . they are also considered distinct from private equity funds and other similar closed-end funds , as hedge funds generally invest in relatively liquid assets and are generally open-ended , meaning that they allow investors to invest and withdraw capital periodically based on the fund 's net asset value , whereas private equity funds generally invest in illiquid assets and only return capital after a number of years . however , other than a fund 's regulatory status there are no formal or fixed definitions of fund types , and so there are different views of what can constitute a `` hedge fund '' .although hedge funds are not subject to many restrictions that apply to regulated funds , regulations were passed in the united states and europe following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 with the intention of increasing government oversight of hedge funds and eliminating certain regulatory gaps.although most modern hedge funds are able to employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management technique , they can be very different from each other in respect of their strategies , risks , volatility and expected return profile . it is common for hedge fund investment strategies to aim to achieve a positive return on investment regardless of whether markets are rising or falling ( `` absolute return '' ) . although hedge funds can be considered risky investments , the expected returns of some hedge fund strategies are less volatile than those of retail funds with high exposure to stock markets , because of the use of hedging techniques.a hedge fund typically pays its investment manager a management fee ( for example , 2 % ( annualised ) of the net asset value of the fund ) , and a performance fee ( for example , 20 % of the increase in the fund 's net asset value during a year ) .hedge funds have existed for many decades , and have become increasingly popular . they have now grown to be a substantial fraction of the asset management industry , with assets totaling around $ 3.2 trillion . some hedge fund managers have several billion dollars of assets under management ( aum ) .

anonymous is a decentralized international activist/hacktivist collective/movement that is widely known for its various cyber attacks against several governments , government institutions and government agencies , corporations , and the church of scientology.anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic , digitized global brain . anonymous members ( known as `` anons '' ) can be distinguished in public by the wearing of guy fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film `` v for vendetta '' . however , this may not always be the case as some of the collective prefer to instead cover their face without using the well-known mask as a disguise . some anons also opt to mask their voices through voice changers or text-to-speech programs.in its early form , the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner , usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal and primarily focused on entertainment ( or lulz ) . beginning with project chanology in 2008—a series of protests , pranks , and hacks targeting the church of scientology—the anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally . individuals claiming to align themselves with anonymous undertook protests and other actions ( including direct action ) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations . later targets of anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the united states , israel , tunisia , uganda and others ; the islamic state of iraq and the levant ; child pornography sites ; copyright protection agencies ; the westboro baptist church ; and corporations such as paypal , mastercard , visa , and sony . anons have publicly supported wikileaks and the occupy movement . related groups lulzsec and operation antisec carried out cyberattacks on u.s. government agencies , media , video game companies , military contractors , military personnel , and police officers , resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups ' activities.dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in anonymous cyberattacks in countries including the united states , the united kingdom , australia , the netherlands , spain , india , and turkey . evaluations of the group 's actions and effectiveness vary widely . supporters have called the group `` freedom fighters '' and digital robin hoods while critics have described them as `` a cyber lynch-mob '' or `` cyber terrorists '' . in 2012 , `` time '' called anonymous one of the `` 100 most influential people '' in the world . anonymous ' media profile diminished over the last few years , but the group re-emerged in 2020 to support the george floyd protests .

the kosovo liberation army ( kla ; , ) was an ethnic-albanian separatist militia that sought the separation of kosovo from the federal republic of yugoslavia ( fry ) and serbia during the 1990s and the eventual creation of greater albania due to the presence of a vast ethnic majority of albanians in the region , stressing albanian culture , ethnicity and nation.military precursors to the kla began in the late 1980s with armed resistance to yugoslav police trying to take albanian activists in custody . by early 1990s there were attacks on police forces and secret-service officials who abused albanian civilians . by mid-1998 the kla was involved in frontal battle though it was outnumbered and outgunned . conflict escalated from 1997 onward due to the yugoslavian army retaliating with a crackdown in the region which resulted in violence and population displacements.in september 1999 , with the fighting over and an international force in place within kosovo , the kla was officially disbanded and thousands of its members entered the kosovo protection corps , a civilian emergency protection body that replaced the kla and kosovo police force , as foreseen in united nations security council resolution 1244 . the ending of the kosovo war resulted in the emergence of offshoot guerilla groups and political organisations from the kla continuing violent struggles in southern serbia ( 1999–2001 ) and northwestern macedonia ( 2001 ) , which resulted in peace talks and greater albanian rights . former kla leaders also entered politics , some of them reaching high-ranking offices.the kla received large funds from albanian diaspora organizations . there have been allegations that it used narcoterrorism to finance its operations . abuses and war crimes were committed by the kla during and after the conflict , such as massacres of civilians , prison camps and destruction of cultural heritage sites . in april 2014 , the assembly of kosovo considered and approved the establishment of a special court to try cases involving crimes and other serious abuses allegedly committed in 1999–2000 by members of the kla . the kla is regarded as one of the most successful insurgencies of the post-cold war period and as a model insurgency , with its quick success coming mostly from an unusual configuration of geopolitical and popular phenomena.in june 2020 the kosovo specialist chambers and specialist prosecutor 's office filed indictments for crimes against humanity and war crimes against a number of former kla members , including the president of kosovo hashim thaçi .

a tornado watch ( same code : toa ) is an alert issued by national weather forecasting agencies when weather conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms that are capable of producing tornadoes . a tornado watch therefore implies that it is also a severe thunderstorm watch . a tornado watch must not be confused with a tornado warning . in most cases , the potential exists for large hail and/or damaging winds in addition to tornadoes.a watch does not mean that the severe weather is actually occurring , only that atmospheric conditions have created a significant risk for it . if severe weather actually does occur , a tornado warning or severe thunderstorm warning would then be issued . note that a watch is not required for a warning to be issued ; tornado warnings are occasionally issued when a tornado watch is not active ( i.e . when a severe thunderstorm watch is active , or when no watches are in effect ) , if a severe thunderstorm develops and has a confirmed tornado or strong rotation.in the united states , the storm prediction center – a national guidance center of the national weather service ( nws ) – issues watches for areas likely to produce tornadoes and severe thunderstorms . the watch boxes ( or weather watches , wws ) are usually outlined in the format of `` x '' miles north and south , or east and west , or either side of a line from `` y '' miles `` direction '' of `` city , state '' , to `` z '' miles `` another direction '' of `` another city , state '' . for example : `` 50 miles either side of a line from 10 miles northeast of columbia , south carolina to 15 miles south-southwest of montgomery , alabama '' ( `` either side '' means perpendicular to the center line ) . in addition , a list of all counties included in its area of responsibility is now issued by each nws forecast office for each watch.in the event that a tornado watch is likely to lead to a major tornado outbreak along with possible destructive winds and hail , enhanced wording with the words particularly dangerous situation ( pds ) can be added to the watch ; this is occasionally issued when atmospheric conditions are deemed sufficient to breed development of severe thunderstorms that are capable of producing significant tornadoes ( either from supercells that develop strong , low-level rotation under typical tornadogenesis during the storm 's maturation stage , or by thunderstorms that initiate mesocyclone maturation during their early development through a combination of sufficient wind shear and very high convective available potential energy ( cape ) values ) . occasionally , a tornado watch may replace a severe thunderstorm watch ( or a portion of one ) should conditions that were originally forecast to be conducive for non-tornadic severe thunderstorms change to allow possible tornado formation.in canada , the criteria used to issue a tornado watch are the same and watches are issued by regional offices of the meteorological service of canada of environment canada in vancouver , edmonton , toronto , montreal and halifax , on a county or regional basis.the term `` red box '' refers to the assigned coloring used for watch box outlines used in storm prediction center and national weather service products ; television stations typically assign other colors ( colors used may vary , but very seldom if ever red , which is usually reserved for identifying tornado warnings ; yellow is the most commonly used to denote them ) to highlight tornado watches in severe weather advisory displays .

in christianity , annihilationism ( also known as extinctionism or destructionism ) is the belief that those who are wicked will perish or be no more . it states that after the final judgment all unsaved human beings and all fallen angels ( all of the damned ) and satan himself will be totally destroyed so as to not exist , or that their consciousness will be extinguished rather than suffer everlasting torment in hell ( often synonymized with the lake of fire ) .annihilationism is directly related to the doctrine of conditional immortality , the idea that a human soul is not immortal unless it is given eternal life . annihilationism asserts that god will eventually destroy the wicked , leaving only the righteous to live on in immortality . some annihilationists ( e.g . seventh-day adventists ) believe god 's love is scripturally described as an all-consuming fire and that sinful creatures can not exist in god 's presence . thus those who do not repent of their sins are eternally destroyed because of the inherent incompatibility of sin with god 's holy character . seventh-day adventists posit that living in eternal hell is a false doctrine of pagan origin , as the wicked will perish in the lake of fire . jehovah’s witnesses believe that there can be no punishment after death because the dead cease to exist.annihilationism stands in contrast to both belief in eternal torture and suffering in the lake of fire , and the belief that everyone will be saved ( universal reconciliation or simply `` universalism '' ) .the belief in annihilationism has appeared throughout christian history , but has always been in the minority . it experienced a resurgence in the 1980s when several prominent theologians including john stott were prepared to argue that it could be held sincerely as a legitimate interpretation of biblical texts ( alternative to the more traditional interpretation of them ) , by those who give supreme authority to scripture . earlier in the 20th century , some theologians at the university of cambridge including basil atkinson supported the belief . 20th-century english theologians who favor annihilation include bishop charles gore ( 1916 ) , william temple , 98th archbishop of canterbury ( 1924 ) ; oliver chase quick , chaplain to the archbishop of canterbury ( 1933 ) , ulrich ernst simon ( 1964 ) , and g. b. caird ( 1966 ) .some christian denominations which are annihilationist were influenced by the millerite/adventist movement of the mid-19th century . these include the seventh-day adventists , bible students , christadelphians and the various advent christian churches . additionally , the church of england 's doctrine commission reported in 1995 that `` [ h ] ell is not eternal torment '' , but `` non-being '' . some protestant and anglican writers have also proposed annihilationist doctrines.annihilationists base the doctrine on their exegesis of scripture , some early church writing , historical criticism of the doctrine of hell , and the concept of god as too loving to torment his creations forever . they claim that the popular conceptions of hell stem from jewish speculation during the intertestamental period , belief in an immortal soul which originated in greek philosophy and influenced christian theologians , and also graphic and imaginative medieval art and poetry .

the history of poland ( ) spans over a thousand years , from medieval tribes , christianization and monarchy ; through poland 's golden age , expansionism and becoming one of the largest european powers ; to its collapse and partitions , two world wars , communism , and the restoration of democracy.the roots of polish history can be traced to the iron age , when the territory of present-day poland was settled by various tribes including celts , scythians , germanic clans , sarmatians , slavs and balts . however , it was the west slavic lechites , the closest ancestors of ethnic poles , who established permanent settlements in the polish lands during the early middle ages . the lechitic western polans , a tribe whose name means `` people living in open fields '' , dominated the region , and gave poland - which lies in the north-central european plain - its name.the first ruling dynasty , the piasts , emerged in the 10th century ad . duke mieszko i is considered the `` de facto '' creator of the polish state and is widely recognized for his adoption of western christianity in 966 ce . mieszko 's dominion was formally reconstituted as a medieval kingdom in 1025 by his son bolesław i the brave , known for military expansion under his rule . the most successful and the last piast monarch , casimir iii the great , presided over a period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs . the period of the jagiellonian dynasty in the 14th–16th centuries brought close ties with the lithuania , a cultural renaissance in poland and continued territorial expansion as well as polonization that culminated in the establishment of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth in 1569 , one of europe 's largest countries.the commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the jagiellonian period , while its political system matured as a unique noble democracy with an elective monarchy . from the mid-17th century , however , the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system . significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century , such as europe 's first constitution of 3 may 1791 , but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance . the existence of the commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and partitions of polish territory carried out by the russian empire in the east , the kingdom of prussia in the west and the habsburg monarchy in the south . from 1795 until 1918 , no truly independent polish state existed , although strong polish resistance movements operated . the opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after world war i , when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.the second polish republic was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939 , when nazi germany and the soviet union invaded poland , marking the beginning of world war ii . millions of polish citizens of different faiths or identities perished in the course of the nazi occupation of poland between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and extermination . a polish government-in-exile nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the poles contributed to the allied victory through participation in military campaigns on both the eastern and western fronts . the westward advances of the soviet red army in 1944 and 1945 compelled nazi germany 's forces to retreat from poland , which led to the establishment of a satellite communist country , known from 1952 as the polish people 's republic.as a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the allies at the end of world war ii in 1945 , poland 's geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west and the re-defined polish lands largely lost their historic multi-ethnic character through the extermination , expulsion and migration of various ethnic groups during and after the war . by the late 1980s , the polish reform movement solidarity became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a planned economy and a communist state to a capitalist economic system and a liberal parliamentary democracy . this process resulted in the creation of the modern polish state , the third polish republic , founded in 1989 .

franz joseph i or francis joseph i ( ; 18 august 1830 – 21 november 1916 ) was emperor of austria , king of hungary , croatia , and bohemia , and monarch of other states of the austro-hungarian empire , from 2 december 1848 until his death . from 1 may 1850 to 24 august 1866 he was also president of the german confederation . he was the longest-reigning ruler of austria and hungary , as well as the fourth-longest-reigning monarch of any country in european history.in december 1848 , emperor ferdinand abdicated the throne at olomouc , as part of minister president felix zu schwarzenberg 's plan to end the revolutions of 1848 in hungary . this allowed ferdinand 's nephew franz joseph to accede to the throne . largely considered to be a reactionary , franz joseph spent his early reign resisting constitutionalism in his domains . the austrian empire was forced to cede its influence over tuscany and most of its claim to lombardy–venetia to the kingdom of piedmont-sardinia , following the second italian war of independence in 1859 and the third italian war of independence in 1866 . although franz joseph ceded no territory to the kingdom of prussia after the austrian defeat in the austro-prussian war , the peace of prague ( 23 august 1866 ) settled the german question in favour of prussia , which prevented the unification of germany from occurring under the house of habsburg.franz joseph was troubled by nationalism during his entire reign . he concluded the austro-hungarian compromise of 1867 , which granted greater autonomy to hungary and transformed the austrian empire into the dual monarchy of austria-hungary . he ruled peacefully for the next 45 years , but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother , the emperor maximilian of mexico in 1867 , the suicide of his only son and heir-apparent , crown prince rudolf , in 1889 , the assassination of his wife , empress elisabeth ( `` sisi '' ) , in 1898 , and the assassination of his nephew and heir-presumptive , the archduke franz ferdinand , in 1914.after the austro-prussian war , austria-hungary turned its attention to the balkans , which was a hotspot of international tension because of conflicting interests with the russian empire . the bosnian crisis was a result of franz joseph 's annexation of bosnia and herzegovina in 1908 , which had been occupied by his troops since the congress of berlin ( 1878 ) .on 28 june 1914 , the assassination of his nephew and heir-presumptive , archduke franz ferdinand , in sarajevo resulted in austria-hungary 's declaration of war against the kingdom of serbia , which was an ally of the russian empire . that activated a system of alliances which resulted in world war i.franz joseph died on 21 november 1916 , after ruling his domains for almost 68 years as one of the longest-reigning monarchs in modern history . he was succeeded by his grandnephew charles .

appeal to emotion or argumentum ad passiones ( `` argument from passion '' ) is a logical fallacy characterized by the manipulation of the recipient 's emotions in order to win an argument , especially in the absence of factual evidence . this kind of appeal to emotion is a type of red herring and encompasses several logical fallacies , including appeal to consequences , appeal to fear , appeal to flattery , appeal to pity , appeal to ridicule , appeal to spite , and wishful thinking.the appeal to emotion is only fallacious when the emotions that are elicited are irrelevant to evaluating the truth of the conclusion and serve to distract from rational consideration of relevant premises or information . for instance , if a student says `` if i fail this paper i will lose my scholarship . it 's not plagiarized '' the emotions elicited by the first statement are not relevant to establishing whether the paper was plagiarized . on the other hand , `` look at the suffering children . we must do more for refugees . '' is not uncontroversially fallacious , because the suffering of the children and our emotional perception of the badness of suffering may be relevant to the conclusion . to be sure , the proper role for emotion in moral reasoning is a contested issue in ethics , but the charge of `` appeal to emotion '' often can not be made without begging the question against theories of moral cognition that reserve a role for emotion in moral reasoning.appeals to emotion are intended to draw inward feelings such as fear , pity , and joy from the recipient of the information with the end goal of convincing them that the statements being presented in the fallacious argument are true or false , resp . 
a gene family is a set of several similar genes , formed by duplication of a single original gene , and generally with similar biochemical functions . one such family are the genes for human hemoglobin subunits ; the ten genes are in two clusters on different chromosomes , called the α-globin and β-globin loci . these two gene clusters are thought to have arisen as a result of a precursor gene being duplicated approximately 500 million years ago.genes are categorized into families based on shared nucleotide or protein sequences . phylogenetic techniques can be used as a more rigorous test . the positions of exons within the coding sequence can be used to infer common ancestry . knowing the sequence of the protein encoded by a gene can allow researchers to apply methods that find similarities among protein sequences that provide more information than similarities or differences among dna sequences.if the genes of a gene family encode proteins , the term `` protein family '' is often used in an analogous manner to `` gene family '' .the expansion or contraction of gene families along a specific lineage can be due to chance , or can be the result ofnatural selection . to distinguish between these two cases is often difficult in practice . recent work uses a combinationof statistical models and algorithmic techniques to detect gene families that are under the effect of natural selection.the hugo gene nomenclature committee ( hgnc ) creates nomenclature schemes using a `` stem '' ( or `` root '' ) symbol for members of a gene family , with a hierarchical numbering system to distinguish the individual members . for example , for the peroxiredoxin family , `` prdx '' is the root symbol , and the family members are `` prdx1 '' , `` prdx2 '' , `` prdx3 '' , `` prdx4 '' , `` prdx5 '' , and `` prdx6 '' .

the reception history of jane austen follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity . jane austen ( 1775–1817 ) , the author of such works as `` pride and prejudice '' ( 1813 ) and `` emma '' ( 1815 ) , has become one of the best-known and most widely read novelists in the english language . her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.during her lifetime , austen 's novels brought her little personal fame . like many women writers , she chose to publish anonymously , but her authorship was an open secret . at the time they were published , austen 's works were considered fashionable , but received only a few reviews , albeit positive . by the mid-19th century , her novels were admired by members of the literary elite who viewed their appreciation of her works as a mark of cultivation , but they were also being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838 . the first illustrated edition of her works appeared in 1833 , in richard bentley 's standard novels series , which put her titles before thousands of readers across the victorian period.the publication in 1870 of her nephew 's `` memoir of jane austen '' introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality—dear aunt jane—and her works were republished in popular editions . by the start of the 20th century , competing groups had sprung up—some to worship her and some to defend her from the `` teeming masses '' —but all claiming to be the true janeites , or those who properly appreciated her . the `` teeming masses '' , meanwhile , were creating their own ways of honouring austen , including in amateur theatricals in drawing rooms , schools , and community groups.in 1923 , the publisher and scholar r. w. chapman prepared a carefully edited collection of her works , which some have claimed is the first serious scholarly treatment given to any british novelist . by mid-century , austen was widely accepted within academia as a great english novelist . the second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of austen scholarship , which explored numerous aspects of her works : artistic , ideological , and historical . with the growing professionalisation of university english departments in the second half of the 20th century , criticism of austen became more theoretical and specialized , as did literary studies in general . as a result , commentary on austen sometimes seemed to imagine itself as divided into high culture and popular culture branches . in the mid- to late 20th century , fans founded jane austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author , her time , and her works . as of the early 21st century , austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations , which started with the 1940 film `` pride and prejudice '' and evolved to include productions such as the 2004 bollywood-style film `` bride and prejudice '' .on november 5 , 2019 , the `` bbc news '' listed `` pride and prejudice '' on its list of the 100 most influential novels .

penetrating trauma is an injury that occurs when an object pierces the skin and enters a tissue of the body , creating an open wound . ( in blunt , or non-penetrating trauma , there may be an impact , but the skin is not necessarily broken . ) the penetrating object may remain in the tissues , come back out the way it entered , or pass through the tissues and exit from another area . an injury in which an object enters the body or a structure and passes all the way through is called a perforating injury , while `` penetrating trauma '' implies that the object does not pass through . perforating trauma is associated with an entrance wound and an often larger exit wound.penetrating trauma can be caused by a foreign object or by fragments of a broken bone . usually occurring in violent crime or armed combat , penetrating injuries are commonly caused by gunshots and stabbings.penetrating trauma can be serious because it can damage internal organs and presents a risk of shock and infection . the severity of the injury varies widely depending on the body parts involved , the characteristics of the penetrating object , and the amount of energy transmitted to the tissues . assessment may involve x-rays or ct scans , and treatment may involve surgery , for example to repair damaged structures or to remove foreign objects . following penetrating trauma , spinal motion restriction is associated with worse outcomes and therefore its should not be done routinely .

bacillus anthracis is the agent of anthrax—a common disease of livestock and , occasionally , of humans—and the only obligate pathogen within the genus `` bacillus '' . this disease can be classified as a zoonosis , causing infected animals to transmit the disease to humans . `` b. anthracis '' is a gram-positive , endospore-forming , rod-shaped bacterium , with a width of 1.0–1.2 µm and a length of 3–5 µm . it can be grown in an ordinary nutrient medium under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.it is one of few bacteria known to synthesize a protein capsule ( poly-d-gamma-glutamic acid ) . like `` bordetella pertussis '' , it forms a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase exotoxin known as anthrax edema factor , along with anthrax lethal factor . it bears close genotypical and phenotypical resemblance to `` bacillus cereus '' and `` bacillus thuringiensis '' . all three species share cellular dimensions and morphology . all form oval spores located centrally in an unswollen sporangium . `` b. anthracis '' endospores , in particular , are highly resilient , surviving extremes of temperature , low-nutrient environments , and harsh chemical treatment over decades or centuries.the endospore is a dehydrated cell with thick walls and additional layers that form inside the cell membrane . it can remain inactive for many years , but if it comes into a favorable environment , it begins to grow again . it initially develops inside the rod-shaped form . features such as the location within the rod , the size and shape of the endospore , and whether or not it causes the wall of the rod to bulge out are characteristic of particular species of `` bacillus '' . depending upon the species , the endospores are round , oval , or occasionally cylindrical . they are highly refractile and contain dipicolinic acid . electron micrograph sections show they have a thin outer endospore coat , a thick spore cortex , and an inner spore membrane surrounding the endospore contents . the endospores resist heat , drying , and many disinfectants ( including 95 % ethanol ) . because of these attributes , `` b. anthracis '' endospores are extraordinarily well-suited to use ( in powdered and aerosol form ) as biological weapons . such weaponization has been accomplished in the past by at least five state bioweapons programs—those of the united kingdom , japan , the united states , russia , and iraq—and has been attempted by several others .

the sports network ( tsn ) is a canadian english language sports specialty channel . established by the labatt brewing company in 1984 as part of the first group of canadian specialty cable channels , since 2001 , tsn has been majority-owned by communications conglomerate bce inc. ( presently through its broadcasting subsidiary bell media ) with a minority stake held by espn inc. via a 20 % share in the bell media subsidiary ctv specialty television . tsn is the largest specialty channel in canada in terms of gross revenue , with a total of $ 400.4 million in revenue in 2013.tsn 's networks focus on sports-related programming , including live and recorded event telecasts , sports talk shows , and other original programming . tsn was the first national cable broadcaster of the national hockey league in canada . its stint has been interrupted twice by rival network sportsnet , most recently as of the 2014–15 season under an exclusive 12-year rights deal . tsn holds regional television rights to four of the nhl 's seven canadian franchises.as of 2015 , major programming rights held by tsn include exclusive coverage of the canadian football league and curling canada 's national championships , coverage of the nba and the toronto raptors , coverage of major league soccer and exclusive rights to toronto fc and vancouver whitecaps fc , along with canadian rights to the tournaments of fifa ( soccer ) and the iihf ( ice hockey ) , the nfl ( american football ) ( shared with sister network ctv ) , formula one , nascar , ultimate fighting championship , and the grand slam tennis tournaments , among others . tsn also receives a large amount of programming through its minority partner , espn.the tsn licence currently comprises five 24-hour programming services ; from its launch until 2006 , tsn operated as a single , national service . in 2006 , the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission ( crtc ) ruled that tsn could operate multiple feeds with a limited amount of alternative national programming—this was followed by the launch of tsn2—a second 24-hour network under the tsn licence that was legally considered a west coast feed of tsn . as of 2010 , tsn has been subject to deregulated category c licensing by the crtc , which allows multiple feeds to be operated under the tsn licence with no restrictions on alternate programming ; tsn used this new ability to operate an autonomous tsn2 , along with part-time feeds for regional nhl coverage.on august 25 , 2014 , the primary tsn service was re-structured into four 24-hour feeds—tsn1 , tsn3 , tsn4 , and tsn5—with each designated as the primary tsn network for each region of canada . tsn now essentially operates as a group of regional sports networks similarly to sportsnet , the 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 channels air some common programming and simulcast major events , while all five channels are capable of airing programming autonomously—including alternative national events and studio shows , supplemental coverage of larger events , and regional programming ( such as nhl games ; subject to blackout outside the respective team 's market ) .

an antibody ( ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( ig ) , is a large , y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses . the antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen , called an antigen , via the fragment antigen-binding ( fab ) variable region . each tip of the `` y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . using this binding mechanism , an antibody can `` tag '' a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . the ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its fc region ( located at the base of the `` y '' ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . the production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system.antibodies are secreted by b cells of the adaptive immune system , mostly by differentiated b cells called plasma cells . antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma , and a membrane-bound form that is attached to the surface of a b cell and is referred to as the b-cell receptor ( bcr ) . the bcr is found only on the surface of b cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory b cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the b cells can respond faster upon future exposure . in most cases , interaction of the b cell with a t helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the b cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding . soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily . they constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins . they are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains . there are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments ( fc ) that may be attached to the antigen-binding fragments ( fab ) . the five different types of fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five `` isotypes '' . each fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific fc receptor ( fcr ) , except for igd , which is essentially the bcr , thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which fcr it binds . the ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding fcr is further modulated by the structure of the glycan ( s ) present at conserved sites within its fc region . the ability of antibodies to bind to fcrs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter . for example , ige is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release . ige 's fab paratope binds to allergic antigen , for example house dust mite particles , while its fc region binds to fc receptor ε . the allergen-ige-fcrε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen-binding sites , to exist . this region is known as the `` hypervariable region '' . each of these variants can bind to a different antigen . this enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens . the large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites ( or `` paratopes '' ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene , which create further diversity . this recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called v ( d ) j or vj recombination . the antibody paratope is polygenic , made up of three genes , v , d , and j . each paratope locus is also polymorphic , such that during antibody production , one allele of v , one of d , and one of j is chosen . these gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope . the regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hypervariable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the one type of heavy chain fc fragment to another , creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region . this allows a single antibody to be used by different types of fc receptors , expressed on different parts of the immune system .

legal tender is a form of money that courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment for any monetary debt . each jurisdiction determines what is legal tender , but essentially it is anything which when offered ( `` tendered '' ) in payment of a debt extinguishes the debt . there is no obligation on the creditor to accept the tendered payment , but the act of tendering the payment in legal tender discharges the debt.some jurisdictions allow contract law to overrule the status of legal tender , allowing for example merchants to specify that they will not accept cash payments . coins and banknotes are usually defined as legal tender in many countries , but personal cheques , credit cards , and similar non-cash methods of payment are usually not . some jurisdictions may include a specific foreign currency as legal tender , at times as its exclusive legal tender or concurrently with its domestic currency . some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made by other than legal tender . in some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment ( where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment ) . for example , vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote . shopkeepers may reject large banknotes , which is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat.the right , in many jurisdictions , of a trader to refuse to do business with any person means that a would-be purchaser may not force a purchase merely by presenting legal tender , as legal tender only must be accepted for debts already incurred.under u.s. federal law , cash in u.s. dollars is a valid and legal offer of payment for antecedent debts when tendered to a creditor . by contrast , federal statutes do not require a seller to accept federal currency or coins as payment for goods or services simultaneously exchanged . therefore , private businesses may formulate their own policies on whether to accept cash unless state law requires otherwise .

erich alfred hartmann ( 19 april 1922 – 20 september 1993 ) was a german fighter pilot during world war ii and the most successful fighter ace in the history of aerial warfare . he flew 1,404 combat missions and participated in aerial combat on 825 separate occasions . he was credited with shooting down 352 allied aircraft—345 soviet and seven american—while serving with the luftwaffe . during the course of his career , hartmann was forced to crash-land his fighter 16 times due to either damage received from parts of enemy aircraft he had just shot down or mechanical failure.hartmann , a pre-war glider pilot , joined the luftwaffe in 1940 and completed his fighter pilot training in 1942 . he was posted to the veteran jagdgeschwader 52 ( jg 52 ) on the eastern front and was fortunate to be placed under the supervision of some of the luftwaffes most experienced fighter pilots . under their guidance , hartmann steadily developed his tactics.on 29 october 1943 he was awarded the knight 's cross of the iron cross for 148 enemy aircraft destroyed and the oak leaves to the knight 's cross for 202 enemy aircraft on 2 march 1944 , followed by the swords to the knight 's cross with oak leaves exactly four months later for 268 enemy aircraft shot down . ultimately , hartmann earned the coveted knight 's cross of the iron cross with oak leaves , swords and diamonds on 25 august 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories . at the time of its presentation to hartmann , this was germany 's highest military decoration.hartmann achieved his 352nd and last aerial victory at midday on 8 may 1945 , hours before the german surrender . along with the remainder of jg 52 , he surrendered to united states army forces and was turned over to the red army . in an attempt to pressure him into service with the soviet-friendly east german national people 's army , he was tried on war crimes charges and convicted . he was initially sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment , later increased to 25 years , and spent 10 years in various soviet prison camps and gulags until he was released in 1955 . in 1997 , the russian federation ( posthumously ) relieved him of all charges.in 1956 , hartmann joined the newly established west german air force in the `` bundeswehr '' , and became the first `` geschwaderkommodore '' of jagdgeschwader 71 `` richthofen '' . he was retired in 1970 , due to his opposition to the procurement of the f-104 starfighter . in his later years , after his military career had ended , he became a civilian flight instructor . erich hartmann died on 20 september 1993 aged 71 .

the messerschmitt me 210 was a german heavy fighter and ground-attack aircraft of world war ii . design started before the war , as a replacement for the bf 110 . the first examples were ready in 1939 , but they proved to have unacceptably poor flight characteristics due to serious wing planform and fuselage design flaws . a large-scale operational testing program throughout 1941 and early 1942 did not cure the type 's problems . the design entered limited service in 1943 , but was almost immediately replaced by the messerschmitt me 410 `` hornisse '' ( `` hornet '' ) . the me 410 was a further development of the me 210 , renamed so as to avoid the 210 's notoriety . the failure of the me 210 's development program meant the `` luftwaffe '' was forced to continue operating the bf 110 after it had become outdated , despite mounting losses . 
an ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac within the ovary . often they cause no symptoms . occasionally they may produce bloating , lower abdominal pain , or lower back pain . the majority of cysts are harmless . if the cyst either breaks open or causes twisting of the ovary , it may cause severe pain . this may result in vomiting or feeling faint.most ovarian cysts are related to ovulation , being either follicular cysts or corpus luteum cysts . other types include cysts due to endometriosis , dermoid cysts , and cystadenomas . many small cysts occur in both ovaries in polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) . pelvic inflammatory disease may also result in cysts . rarely , cysts may be a form of ovarian cancer . diagnosis is undertaken by pelvic examination with an ultrasound or other testing used to gather further details.often , cysts are simply observed over time . if they cause pain , medications such as paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) or ibuprofen may be used . hormonal birth control may be used to prevent further cysts in those who are frequently affected . however , evidence does not support birth control as a treatment of current cysts . if they do not go away after several months , get larger , look unusual , or cause pain , they may be removed by surgery.most women of reproductive age develop small cysts each month . large cysts that cause problems occur in about 8 % of women before menopause . ovarian cysts are present in about 16 % of women after menopause and if present are more likely to be cancer . 
the french colonial empire constituted the overseas colonies , protectorates and mandate territories that came under french rule from the 16th century onward . a distinction is generally made between the `` first french colonial empire , '' that existed until 1814 , by which time most of it had been lost or sold , and the `` second french colonial empire '' , which began with the conquest of algiers in 1830 . at its apex , the second french colonial empire was one of the largest empires in history . including metropolitan france , the total amount of land under french sovereignty reached in 1920 , with a population of 110 million people in 1936.the main competition included spain , portugal , the dutch united provinces and england and later great britain and russia . france began to establish colonies in north america , the caribbean and india in the 17th century but lost most of its conquests following its defeat in the seven years ' war . the north american holdings were ceded to britain and spain but the later retroceded louisiana ( new france ) back to france in 1800 . the territory was then sold to the united states in 1803 ( louisiana purchase ) . france rebuilt a new empire mostly after 1850 , concentrating chiefly in africa as well as indochina and the south pacific . republicans , at first hostile to empire , only became supportive when germany after 1880 started to build its own colonial empire . as it developed , the new french empire took on roles of trade with the motherland , supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items . rebuilding an empire rebuilt french prestige , especially regarding international power and spreading the french language and the catholic religion . it also provided manpower in the world wars.a major goal was the or `` the civilizing mission '' . 'civilizing ' the populations of africa through spreading language and religion , were used as justifications for many of the brutal practices that came with the french colonial project . in 1884 , the leading proponent of colonialism , jules ferry , declared ; `` the higher races have a right over the lower races , they have a duty to civilize the inferior races . '' full citizenship rights – – were offered , although in reality `` assimilation was always receding [ and ] the colonial populations treated like subjects not citizens . '' france sent small numbers of settlers to its empire , with the notable exception of algeria , where the french settlers took power while being a minority.in world war ii , charles de gaulle and the free french took control of the overseas colonies one-by-one and used them as bases from which they prepared to liberate france . historian tony chafer argues : `` in an effort to restore its world-power status after the humiliation of defeat and occupation , france was eager to maintain its overseas empire at the end of the second world war . '' however , after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge european authority . major revolts in indochina and algeria proved very expensive and france lost both colonies . then followed a relatively peaceful decolonization elsewhere after 1960 . the french constitution of 27 october 1946 ( fourth republic ) , established the french union which endured until 1958 . newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into france as overseas departments and territories within the french republic . these now total altogether 119,394 km² ( 46,098 sq . miles ) , with 2.7 million people in 2013 . by the 1970s , says robert aldrich , the last `` vestiges of empire held little interest for the french . '' he argues , `` except for the traumatic decolonization of algeria , however , what is remarkable is how few long-lasting effects on france the giving up of empire entailed . ''

independence day is celebrated annually on 15 august as a national holiday in india commemorating the nation 's independence from the united kingdom on 15 august 1947 , the day when the provisions of the indian independence act 1947 , which transferred legislative sovereignty to the indian constituent assembly , came into effect . india retained king george vi as head of state until its transition to a full republic , when the nation adopted the constitution of india on 26 january 1950 ( celebrated as indian republic day ) and replaced the dominion prefix , dominion of india , with the enactment of the sovereign law constitution of india . india attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.independence coincided with the partition of india , in which british india was divided along religious lines into the dominions of india and pakistan ; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties , and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence . on 15 august 1947 , the first prime minister of india , jawaharlal nehru raised the indian national flag above the lahori gate of the red fort in delhi . on each subsequent independence day , the incumbent prime minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the nation . the entire event is broadcast by doordarshan , india 's national broadcaster , and usually begins with the shehnai music of ustad bismillah khan.independence day is observed throughout india with flag-hoisting ceremonies , parades and cultural events . it is a national holiday . 
silhak was a korean confucian social reform movement in late joseon dynasty . `` sil '' means `` actual '' or `` practical , '' and `` hak '' means `` studies '' or `` learning . '' it developed in response to the increasingly metaphysical nature of neo-confucianism ( 성리학 ) that seemed disconnected from the rapid agricultural , industrial , and political changes occurring in korea between the late 17th and early 19th centuries . silhak was designed to counter the `` uncritical '' following of confucian teachings and the strict adherence to `` formalism '' and `` ritual '' by neo-confucians . most of the silhak scholars were from factions excluded from power and other disaffected scholars calling for reform . they advocated an empirical confucianism deeply concerned with human society at the practical level.its proponents generally argued for reforming the rigid confucian social structure , land reforms to relieve the plight of peasant farmers , promoting korea 's own national identity and culture , encouraging the study of science , and advocating technology exchange with foreign countries . silhak scholars wanted to use realistic and experimental approaches to social problems with the consideration of the welfare of the people . silhak scholars encouraged human equality and moved toward a more korean-centric view of korean history . the silhak school is credited with helping to create a modern korea .

clostridium perfringens ( formerly known as `` c. welchii '' , or `` bacillus welchii '' ) is a gram-positive , rod-shaped , anaerobic , spore-forming pathogenic bacterium of the genus `` clostridium '' . `` c. perfringens '' is ever-present in nature and can be found as a normal component of decaying vegetation , marine sediment , the intestinal tract of humans and other vertebrates , insects , and soil . it has the shortest reported generation time of any organism at 6.3 minutes in thioglycolate medium. '' c . perfringens '' is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the united states , alongside norovirus , `` salmonella '' , `` campylobacter '' , and `` staphylococcus aureus '' . however , it can sometimes be ingested and cause no harm.infections due to `` c. perfringens '' show evidence of tissue necrosis , bacteremia , emphysematous cholecystitis , and gas gangrene , also known as clostridial myonecrosis . the specific name `` perfringens '' is derived from the latin `` per '' ( meaning `` through '' ) and `` frango '' ( `` burst '' ) , referring to the disruption of tissue that occurs during gas gangrene . the toxin involved in gas gangrene is α-toxin , which inserts into the plasma membrane of cells , producing gaps in the membrane that disrupt normal cellular function . `` c. perfringens '' can participate in polymicrobial anaerobic infections . it is commonly encountered in infections as a component of the normal flora . in this case , its role in disease is minor.the action of `` c. perfringens '' on dead bodies is known to mortuary workers as tissue gas . it causes extremely accelerated decomposition , and can not be stopped by normal embalming measures . these bacteria are resistant to the presence of formaldehyde in normal concentrations .

a cellular automaton ( pl . cellular automata , abbrev . ca ) is a discrete model studied in automata theory . cellular automata are also called cellular spaces , tessellation automata , homogeneous structures , cellular structures , tessellation structures , and iterative arrays . cellular automata have found application in various areas , including physics , theoretical biology and microstructure modeling.a cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of `` cells '' , each in one of a finite number of `` states '' , such as `` on '' and `` off '' ( in contrast to a coupled map lattice ) . the grid can be in any finite number of dimensions . for each cell , a set of cells called its `` neighborhood '' is defined relative to the specified cell . an initial state ( time `` t '' = 0 ) is selected by assigning a state for each cell . a new `` generation '' is created ( advancing `` t '' by 1 ) , according to some fixed `` rule '' ( generally , a mathematical function ) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood . typically , the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time , and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously , though exceptions are known , such as the stochastic cellular automaton and asynchronous cellular automaton.the concept was originally discovered in the 1940s by stanislaw ulam and john von neumann while they were contemporaries at los alamos national laboratory . while studied by some throughout the 1950s and 1960s , it was not until the 1970s and conway 's game of life , a two-dimensional cellular automaton , that interest in the subject expanded beyond academia . in the 1980s , stephen wolfram engaged in a systematic study of one-dimensional cellular automata , or what he calls elementary cellular automata ; his research assistant matthew cook showed that one of these rules is turing-complete . wolfram published `` a new kind of science '' in 2002 , claiming that cellular automata have applications in many fields of science . these include computer processors and cryptography.the primary classifications of cellular automata , as outlined by wolfram , are numbered one to four . they are , in order , automata in which patterns generally stabilize into homogeneity , automata in which patterns evolve into mostly stable or oscillating structures , automata in which patterns evolve in a seemingly chaotic fashion , and automata in which patterns become extremely complex and may last for a long time , with stable local structures . this last class are thought to be computationally universal , or capable of simulating a turing machine . special types of cellular automata are `` reversible '' , where only a single configuration leads directly to a subsequent one , and `` totalistic '' , in which the future value of individual cells only depends on the total value of a group of neighboring cells . cellular automata can simulate a variety of real-world systems , including biological and chemical ones .

skegness ( ) is a seaside town and civil parish in lincolnshire , england . on the lincolnshire coast of the north sea , the town is east of lincoln and north-east of boston . with a population of 19,579 , it is the largest settlement in the east lindsey district ; it also incorporates winthorpe ( previously its own parish ) and seacroft , and forms a larger built-up area with the resorts of ingoldmells and chapel st leonards to the north . the town is on the a52 and a158 roads , connecting it with boston and the east midlands , and lincoln respectively ; skegness railway station is on the nottingham to skegness ( via grantham ) line.historically skegness was situated further east and at the mouth of the wash ; its norse name refers to a headland which sat near the settlement . by the 14th century , skegness was a locally important port for coastal trade . the natural sea defences which protected the harbour eroded in the later middle ages , and it was lost to the sea after a storm in the 1520s . rebuilt along the new shoreline , early modern skegness was a small fishing and farming village , but from the late 18th century members of the local gentry visited for holidays . the arrival of the railways in 1873 transformed it into a popular seaside resort . this was the intention of the landowner , the 9th earl of scarbrough , who built the infrastructure of the town and laid out plots , which he leased to speculative developers . this new skegness quickly became a popular destination for holiday-makers and day trippers from the east midlands factory towns . by the interwar years the town was established as one of the most popular seaside resorts in britain . the layout of the modern seafront dates to this time and holiday camps were built around the town , including the first butlin 's holiday resort which opened in ingoldmells in 1936.the arrival of package holidays abroad in the 1970s and the decline in industrial employment in the east midlands took visitors away from skegness 's in the late 20th century , but it retains a loyal visitor base and has increasingly attracted people visiting for a short holiday alongside their trip abroad ; tourism increased following the great recession owing to its affordability . it has a reputation as a traditional english seaside resort . in 2011 , the town was england 's fourth most popular destination for tourists from the united kingdom , and in 2015 it received over 1.4 million visitors . as well as the long , sandy beach , the seafront 's attractions include amusement arcades , eateries , botton 's fairground and the pier , as well as nightclubs and bars . the town also hosts natureland seal sanctuary , a museum , an aquarium , golf links , a heritage railway , an annual carnival and a yearly arts festival ; to the south is gibraltar point nature reserve.despite the arrival of a number of manufacturing firms since the 1950s and skegness 's prominence as a local commercial centre , the tourism industry remains very important for the economy and employment . its low wages and seasonal nature , along with the town 's aging population , have contributed towards high levels of deprivation among the resident population . residents are served by five state primary schools and a preparatory school , two state secondary schools ( one of which is selective ) , several colleges , a community hospital , several christian places of worship and two local newspapers ; the town is home to the divisional police headquarters , a magistrates court and a lifeboat station .

albert benjamin `` happy '' chandler sr. ( july 14 , 1898 – june 15 , 1991 ) was an american politician from kentucky . he represented kentucky in the u.s. senate and served as its 44th and 49th governor . aside from his political positions , he also served as the second commissioner of baseball from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the baseball hall of fame in 1982 . his grandson , ben chandler , later served as congressman for kentucky 's sixth district.a multi-sport athlete during his college days at transylvania college , chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree . after graduation , he entered politics and was elected as a democrat to the kentucky senate in 1928 . two years later , he was elected lieutenant governor , serving under governor ruby laffoon . chandler and laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state sales tax and when chandler , the presiding officer in the state senate , worked to block the legislation , laffoon 's allies in the general assembly stripped him of many of his statutory powers . the tax then passed by a narrow margin . knowing that laffoon would try to select his own successor at the democratic nominating convention , chandler waited until laffoon left the state—leaving chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory primary election bill . the bill passed , and in the ensuing primary , chandler defeated laffoon 's choice , thomas rhea . he then went on to defeat republican king swope by the largest margin of victory for a kentucky gubernatorial race to that time . as governor , chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax , replacing the lost revenue with new excise taxes and the state 's first income tax . he also enacted a major reorganization of state government , realizing significant savings for the state . he used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state 's education and transportation systems.convinced that he was destined to become president of the united states , chandler challenged senate majority leader alben barkley for his u.s. senate seat in 1938 . during the campaign , president franklin d. roosevelt came to the state to campaign for barkley , and chandler lost a close race . the following year , kentucky 's other senator , marvel mills logan , died in office , and chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat . a fiscal conservative and disciple of virginia 's harry f. byrd , chandler opposed parts of roosevelt 's new deal and openly disagreed with the president 's decision to prioritize european operations in world war ii over the war in the pacific . in 1945 , chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late kenesaw mountain landis as commissioner of baseball . his most significant action as commissioner was the approval of jackie robinson 's contract with the brooklyn dodgers , effectively integrating major league baseball . he also established the first pension fund for major league players , earning him the title `` the players ' commissioner '' . baseball owners were upset with chandler 's governance , however , and did not renew his contract in 1951.following his term as commissioner , chandler returned to kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955 . the major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the racial integration of the state 's public schools and establishing a medical school at the university of kentucky which was later named the chandler medical center in his honor . following his second term as governor , his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963 , 1967 , and 1971 . his endorsement of dark-horse candidate wallace g. wilkinson was seen as critical to wilkinson 's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988 . wilkinson later resisted calls to remove chandler from the university of kentucky board of trustees following chandler 's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988 . in his retirement , chandler made numerous public appearances and remained active in state politics and events . chandler died a month before his ninety-third birthday ; at the time , he was the oldest living former kentucky governor as well as the earliest serving former governor .

in ancient roman religion , mutunus tutunus or mutinus titinus was a phallic marriage deity , in some respects equated with priapus . his shrine was located on the velian hill , supposedly since the founding of rome , until the 1st century bc.during preliminary marriage rites , roman brides are supposed to have straddled the phallus of mutunus to prepare themselves for intercourse , according to church fathers who interpreted this act as an obscene loss of virginity . the christian apologist arnobius says that roman matrons were taken for a ride ( `` inequitare '' ) on tutunus 's `` awful phallus '' with its `` immense shameful parts '' , but other sources specify that it is brides who learned through the ritual not to be embarrassed by sex : `` tutinus , upon whose shameful lap sit brides , so that the god seems to sample their shame before the fact . '' the 2nd-century grammarian festus is the only classical latin source to take note of the god , and the characterization of the rite by christian sources is likely to be hostile or biased .

divination ( from latin `` divinare '' , 'to foresee , to foretell , to predict , to prophesy ' , related to `` divinus '' , 'divine ' ) , or `` to be inspired by a god , '' is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic , standardized process or ritual . used in various forms throughout history , diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs , events , or omens , or through alleged contact with a supernatural agency.divination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appear to be disjointed , random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand . if a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling , divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character , usually in a religious context , as seen in traditional african medicine . fortune-telling , on the other hand , is a more everyday practice for personal purposes . particular divination methods vary by culture and religion.divination has long been criticized . in the modern era , it has been dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstition ; experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it . in antiquity it was attacked by philosophers such as the academic skeptic cicero in `` de divinatione '' and the pyrrhonist sextus empiricus in `` against the astrologers '' . the satirist , lucian , devoted a witty essay to `` alexander the false prophet '' .

in physics and chemistry , ionization energy ( american english spelling ) or ionisation energy ( british english spelling ) , denoted `` e '' , is the minimum amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron , the valence electron , of an isolated neutral gaseous atom or molecule . it is quantitatively expressed aswhere is any atom or molecule capable of ionization , is that atom or molecule with an electron removed , and is the removed electron . this is generally an endothermic process . generally , the closer the outermost electrons to the nucleus of the atom , the higher the atom 's or element 's ionization energy.the sciences of physics and chemistry use different measures of ionization energy . in physics , the unit is the amount of energy required to remove a single electron from a single atom or molecule , expressed as electronvolts . in chemistry , the unit is the amount of energy required for all of the atoms in a mole of substance to lose one electron each : molar ionization energy or enthalpy , expressed as kilojoules per mole ( kj/mol ) or kilocalories per mole ( kcal/mol ) .comparison of `` e '' of elements in the periodic table reveals two periodic trends : the latter trend results from the outer electron shell being progressively further from the nucleus , with the addition of one inner shell per row as one moves down the column.the `` n '' th ionization energy refers to the amount of energy required to remove an electron from the species having a charge of ( `` n '' -1 ) . for example , the first three ionization energies are defined as follows : the term `` ionization potential '' is an older name for ionization energy , because the oldest method of measuring ionization energy was based on ionizing a sample and accelerating the electron removed using an electrostatic potential . however this term is now considered obsolete.some factors affecting the ionization energy include :

the maryland toleration act , also known as the act concerning religion , was religious tolerance for trinitarian christians . it was passed on april 21 , 1649 , by the assembly of the maryland colony , in st. mary 's city . it was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the british north american colonies and created one of the pioneer statutes passed by the legislative body of an organized colonial government to guarantee any degree of religious liberty . specifically , the bill , now usually referred to as the toleration act , granted freedom of conscience to all christians . ( the colony which became rhode island passed a series of laws , the first in 1636 , which prohibited religious persecution including against non-trinitarians ; rhode island was also the first government to separate church and state . ) historians argue that it helped inspire later legal protections for freedom of religion in the united states . the calvert family , who founded maryland partly as a refuge for english catholics , sought enactment of the law to protect catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant anglicanism of britain and her colonies.the act allowed freedom of worship for all trinitarian christians in maryland , but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of jesus . it was revoked in 1654 by william claiborne , a virginian who had been appointed as a commissioner by oliver cromwell ; he was an anglican , a puritan sympathizer , and strongly hostile to the catholic religion . when the calverts regained control of maryland , the act was reinstated , before being repealed permanently in 1692 following the events of the glorious revolution , and the protestant revolution in maryland . as the first law on religious tolerance in the british north america , it influenced related laws in other colonies and portions of it were echoed in the writing of the first amendment to the united states constitution , which enshrined religious freedom in american law .

benzodiazepines ( bzd , bdz , bzs ) , sometimes called `` benzos '' , are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring . the first such drug , chlordiazepoxide ( librium ) , was discovered accidentally by leo sternbach in 1955 , and made available in 1960 by hoffmann–la roche , which , since 1963 , has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam ( valium ) . in 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications . they are in the family of drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers.benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) at the gaba receptor , resulting in sedative , hypnotic ( sleep-inducing ) , anxiolytic ( anti-anxiety ) , anticonvulsant , and muscle relaxant properties . high doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation . these properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety , insomnia , agitation , seizures , muscle spasms , alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures . benzodiazepines are categorized as either short , intermediary , or long-acting . short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia ; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use , although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur . a minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic . benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide . long-term use is controversial because of concerns about decreasing effectiveness , physical dependence , benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome , and an increased risk of dementia and cancer . in the long-term , stopping benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health . the elderly are at an increased risk of both short- and long-term adverse effects , and as a result , all benzodiazepines are listed in the beers list of inappropriate medications for older adults . there is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy . while they are not major teratogens , uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure ; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness . however , they are less toxic than their predecessors , the barbiturates , and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken . when combined with other central nervous system ( cns ) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids , the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases . benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse .

sentientism is a naturalistic ethical philosophy according to which all sentient beings deserve moral consideration . in extending compassion to non-human animals as well as to any potential artificial or alien sentient beings , sentientism can be seen as an extension of or replacement for humanism . as in humanism , supernatural beliefs are rejected in favour of critical , evidence-based thinking . according to sentientism , the ability to experience suffering or positive feeling should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity . non-sentient entities such as protons , plants , rivers , or planets do not warrant direct moral consideration because , based on our current scientific understanding , they do not experience anything at all , including effects of the moral decisions and actions of other beings.sentience as a moral criterion has a long history , from jeremy bentham 's `` an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation '' to contemporary philosophers such as richard d. ryder and peter singer . sentiocentrism and sentientism both grant moral consideration based on sentience . but sentientism , like secular humanism , is explicitly naturalistic across all domains , so it rejects supernatural beliefs of all kinds . someone who holds supernatural or religious beliefs while granting moral consideration based on sentience would therefore be a sentiocentrist but not a sentientist.sentientism differs from anti-speciesism in that it bases moral consideration on sentience and potentially on degrees of sentience , rather than just on rejecting species boundaries . sentientism is also explicitly naturalistic . unlike painism , sentientism takes into account the full range of experience rather than just pain . as all human beings are animals , sentientism is in agreement with animalism that all sentient animals warrant moral consideration ; but sentientism adds that if there exist sentient non-animal beings , such as artificial or alien beings , then they too would warrant moral consideration .

the cape of good hope ( ; ; ) is a rocky headland on the atlantic coast of the cape peninsula in south africa.a common misconception is that the cape of good hope is the southern tip of africa . this misconception was based on the misbelief that the cape was the dividing point between the atlantic and indian oceans . contemporary geographic knowledge instead states the southernmost point of africa is cape agulhas about to the east-southeast . the currents of the two oceans meet at the point where the warm-water agulhas current meets the cold-water benguela current and turns back on itself . that oceanic meeting point fluctuates between cape agulhas and cape point ( about east of the cape of good hope ) .when following the western side of the african coastline from the equator , however , the cape of good hope marks the point where a ship begins to travel more eastward than southward . thus , the first modern rounding of the cape in 1488 by portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias was a milestone in the attempts by the portuguese to establish direct trade relations with the far east ( although herodotus mentioned a claim that the phoenicians had done so far earlier ) . dias called the cape `` cabo das tormentas '' ( `` cape of storms '' ; ) , which was the original name of the `` cape of good hope '' .as one of the great capes of the south atlantic ocean , the cape of good hope has long been of special significance to sailors , many of whom refer to it simply as `` the cape '' . it is a waypoint on the cape route and the clipper route followed by clipper ships to the far east and australia , and still followed by several offshore yacht races.the term `` cape of good hope '' is also used in three other ways :

a media access control address ( mac address ) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller ( nic ) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment . this use is common in most ieee 802 networking technologies , including ethernet , wi-fi , and bluetooth . within the open systems interconnection ( osi ) network model , mac addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of the data link layer . as typically represented , mac addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits , separated by hyphens , colons , or without a separator.mac addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers , and are therefore often referred to as the burned-in address , or as an ethernet hardware address , hardware address , and `` physical address '' . each address can be stored in hardware , such as the card 's read-only memory , or by a firmware mechanism . many network interfaces , however , support changing their mac address . the address typically includes a manufacturer 's organizationally unique identifier ( oui ) . mac addresses are formed according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on extended unique identifiers ( eui ) managed by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) : eui-48 , which replaces the obsolete term mac-48 , and eui-64.network nodes with multiple network interfaces , such as routers and multilayer switches , must have a unique mac address for each nic . 
babylonia ( ) was an ancient akkadian-speaking state and cultural area based in central-southern mesopotamia ( present-day iraq and syria ) . a small amorite-ruled state emerged in 1894 bc , which contained the minor administrative town of babylon . it was merely a small provincial town during the akkadian empire ( 2335–2154 bc ) but greatly expanded during the reign of hammurabi in the first half of the 18th century bc and became a major capital city . during the reign of hammurabi and afterwards , babylonia was called `` the country of akkad '' ( `` māt akkadī '' in akkadian ) , a deliberate archaism in reference to the previous glory of the akkadian empire.it was often involved in rivalry with the older state of assyria to the north and elam to the east in ancient iran . babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after hammurabi ( fl . c. 1792–1752 bc middle chronology , or c. 1696–1654 bc , short chronology ) created a short-lived empire , succeeding the earlier akkadian empire , third dynasty of ur , and old assyrian empire . the babylonian empire , however , rapidly fell apart after the death of hammurabi and reverted to a small kingdom.like assyria , the babylonian state retained the written akkadian language ( the language of its native populace ) for official use , despite its northwest semitic-speaking amorite founders and kassite successors , who spoke a language isolate , not being native mesopotamians . it retained the sumerian language for religious use ( as did assyria ) , but already by the time babylon was founded , this was no longer a spoken language , having been wholly subsumed by akkadian . the earlier akkadian and sumerian traditions played a major role in babylonian and assyrian culture , and the region would remain an important cultural center , even under its protracted periods of outside rule.the earliest mention of the city of babylon can be found in a clay tablet from the reign of sargon of akkad ( 2334–2279 bc ) , dating back to the 23rd century bc . babylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and neither an independent state nor a large city ; like the rest of mesopotamia , it was subject to the akkadian empire which united all the akkadian and sumerian speakers under one rule . after the collapse of the akkadian empire , the south mesopotamian region was dominated by the gutian people for a few decades before the rise of the third dynasty of ur , which restored order to the region and which , apart from northern assyria , encompassed the whole of mesopotamia , including the town of babylon .

gaussian elimination , also known as row reduction , is an algorithm in linear algebra for solving a system of linear equations . it is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients . this method can also be used to find the rank of a matrix , to calculate the determinant of a matrix , and to calculate the inverse of an invertible square matrix . the method is named after carl friedrich gauss ( 1777–1855 ) . some special cases of the method - albeit presented without proof - were known to chinese mathematicians as early as circa 179 ce.to perform row reduction on a matrix , one uses a sequence of elementary row operations to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros , as much as possible . there are three types of elementary row operations : using these operations , a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix , and in fact one that is in row echelon form . once all of the leading coefficients ( the leftmost nonzero entry in each row ) are 1 , and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere , the matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form . this final form is unique ; in other words , it is independent of the sequence of row operations used . for example , in the following sequence of row operations ( where multiple elementary operations might be done at each step ) , the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form , and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form.using row operations to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form is sometimes called gauss–jordan elimination . some authors use the term gaussian elimination to refer to the process until it has reached its upper triangular , or ( unreduced ) row echelon form . for computational reasons , when solving systems of linear equations , it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations before the matrix is completely reduced .

divorce , also known as dissolution of marriage , is the process of terminating a marriage or marital union . divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage , thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state . divorce laws vary considerably around the world , but in most countries , divorce requires the sanction of a court or other authority in a legal process , which may involve issues of distribution of property , child custody , alimony ( spousal support ) , child visitation/access , parenting time , child support , and division of debt . in most countries , monogamy is required by law , so divorce allows each former partner to marry another person.when those that are in a common-law relationship break up , it is referred to as separation , instead of a divorce.divorce is different from annulment , which declares the marriage null and void , with legal separation or `` de jure '' separation ( a legal process by which a married couple may formalize a `` de facto '' separation while remaining legally married ) or with `` de facto separation '' ( a process where the spouses informally stop cohabiting ) . reasons for divorce vary , from sexual incompatibility or lack of independence for one or both spouses to a personality clash.the only countries that do not allow divorce are the philippines , the vatican city and the british crown dependency of sark . in the philippines , divorce for non-muslim filipinos is not legal unless the husband or wife is an alien and satisfies certain conditions . the vatican city is an ecclesiastical state , which has no procedure for divorce . countries that have relatively recently legalized divorce are italy ( 1970 ) , portugal ( 1975 , although from 1910 to 1940 was possible both for the civil and religious marriage ) , brazil ( 1977 ) , spain ( 1981 ) , argentina ( 1987 ) , paraguay ( 1991 ) , colombia ( 1991 ; from 1976 was allowed only for non-catholics ) , andorra ( 1995 ) , ireland ( 1996 ) , chile ( 2004 ) and malta ( 2011 ) .

moby-dick ; or , the whale is an 1851 novel by american writer herman melville . the book is the sailor ishmael 's narrative of the obsessive quest of ahab , captain of the whaling ship `` pequod '' , for revenge on moby dick , the giant white sperm whale that on the ship 's previous voyage bit off ahab 's leg at the knee . a contribution to the literature of the american renaissance , `` moby-dick '' was published to mixed reviews , was a commercial failure , and was out of print at the time of the author 's death in 1891 . its reputation as a `` great american novel '' was established only in the 20th century , after the centennial of its author 's birth . william faulkner said he wished he had written the book himself , and d. h. lawrence called it `` one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world '' and `` the greatest book of the sea ever written '' . its opening sentence , `` call me ishmael '' , is among world literature 's most famous.melville began writing `` moby-dick '' in february 1850 , and finished 18 months later , a year longer than he had anticipated . melville drew on his experience as a common sailor from 1841 to 1844 , including several years on whalers , and on wide reading in whaling literature . the white whale is modeled on the notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale mocha dick , and the book 's ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship `` essex '' in 1820 . his literary influences include shakespeare and the bible . the detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil , as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew , are mixed with exploration of class and social status , good and evil , and the existence of god . in addition to narrative prose , melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs , poetry , and catalogs to shakespearean stage directions , soliloquies , and asides . in august 1850 , with the manuscript perhaps half finished , he met nathaniel hawthorne and was deeply moved by his `` mosses from an old manse '' , which he compared to shakespeare in its cosmic ambitions . this encounter may have inspired him to revise and expand `` moby-dick '' , which is dedicated to hawthorne , `` in token of my admiration for his genius '' .the book was first published ( in three volumes ) as `` the whale '' in london in october 1851 , and under its definitive title in a single-volume edition in new york in november . the london publisher , richard bentley , censored or changed sensitive passages ; melville made revisions as well , including a last-minute change to the title for the new york edition . the whale , however , appears in the text of both editions as `` moby dick '' , without the hyphen . reviewers in britain were largely favorable , though some objected that the tale seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship , as the british edition lacked the epilogue recounting ishmael 's survival . american reviewers were more hostile . about 3,200 copies of the book were sold during the author 's life . 
plagiarism is the representation of another author 's language , thoughts , ideas , or expressions as one 's own original work.plagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics . it is subject to sanctions such as penalties , suspension , expulsion from school or work , substantial fines and even incarceration . recently , cases of `` extreme plagiarism '' have been identified in academia . the modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in europe in the 18th century , particularly with the romantic movement.plagiarism is not in itself a crime , but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court for prejudices caused by copyright infringement , violation of moral rights , or torts . in academia and industry , it is a serious ethical offense . plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent , but they are not equivalent concepts , and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement , which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts.plagiarism might not be the same in all countries . some countries , such as india and poland , consider plagiarism to be a crime , and there have been cases of people being imprisoned for plagiarizing . in other instances plagiarism might be the complete opposite of `` academic dishonesty , '' in fact some countries find the act of plagiarizing a professional 's work flattering . students who move to the united states from countries where plagiarism is not frowned upon often find the transition difficult .

biochemistry , sometimes called biological chemistry , is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms . biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life.for instance , in every living cell , there is a crucial biological process , called respiration . this process is the conversion of glucose into a useful form of energy , which is atp ( adenosine triphosphate ) . the study of biochemistry uncovers the numerous chemical processes involved in converting glucose into carbon dioxide and water.a sub-discipline of both biology and chemistry , biochemistry can be divided into three fields : structural biology , enzymology and metabolism . over the last decades of the 20th century , biochemistry has become successful at explaining living processes through these three disciplines . almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed by biochemical methodology and research . biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells , which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues and organs , as well as organism structure and function.biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology , the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena.much of biochemistry deals with the structures , functions , and interactions of biological macromolecules , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and lipids , which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life . the chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions . these can be inorganic ( for example , water and metal ions ) or organic ( for example , the amino acids , which are used to synthesize proteins ) . the mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism . the findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine , nutrition and agriculture . in medicine , biochemists investigate the causes and cures of diseases . in nutrition , they study how to maintain health and wellness and study the effects of nutritional deficiencies . in agriculture , biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers . they also try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation , crop storage , and pest control .

yogurt ( ; , from ) , also spelled yoghurt , yogourt or yoghourt , is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk . the bacteria used to make yogurt are known as `` yogurt cultures '' . the fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid , which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor . cow 's milk is commonly available worldwide and , as such , is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt . milk from water buffalo , goats , ewes , mares , camels , and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally . the milk used may be homogenized or not . it may be pasteurized or raw . each type of milk produces substantially different results.yogurt is produced using a culture of `` lactobacillus delbrueckii '' subsp . `` bulgaricus '' and `` streptococcus thermophilus '' bacteria . in addition , other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt . some countries require yogurt to contain a certain amount of colony-forming units ( cfu ) of bacteria ; in china , for example , the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 million cfu per milliliter.to produce yogurt , milk is first heated , usually to about 85 °c ( 185 °f ) , to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds . after heating , the milk is allowed to cool to about 45 °c ( 113 °f ) . the bacterial culture is mixed in , and that temperature of 45 °c is maintained for 4 to 12 hours to allow fermentation to occur .

stress , either physiological or biological , is an organism 's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition . stress is the body 's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat , challenge or physical and psychological barrier . stimuli that alter an organism 's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body . in humans and most mammals , the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( hpa ) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress.the sympathoadrenal medullary ( sam ) axis may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system , which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress , while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis . the second major physiological stress-response center , the hpa axis , regulates the release of cortisol , which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic , psychological and immunological functions . the sam and hpa axes are regulated by several brain regions , including the limbic system , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hypothalamus , and stria terminalis.through these mechanisms , stress can alter memory functions , reward , immune function , metabolism and susceptibility to diseases . disease risk is particularly pertinent to mental illnesses , whereby chronic or severe stress remains a common risk factor for several mental illnesses . one system suggests there are five types of stress labeled `` acute time-limited stressors '' , `` brief naturalistic stressors '' , `` stressful event sequences '' , `` chronic stressors '' , and `` distant stressors '' . an acute time-limited stressor involves a short-term challenge , while a brief natural stressor involves an event that is normal but nevertheless challenging . a stressful event sequence is a stressor that occurs , and then continues to yield stress into the immediate future . a chronic stressor involves exposure to a long-term stressor , and a distant stressor is a stressor that is not immediate .

a billion is a number with two distinct definitions : american english adopted the short scale definition from the french . the united kingdom used the long scale billion until 1974 , when the government officially switched to the short scale , but since the 1950s the short scale had already been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism ; the long scale definition still enjoys some limited usage in the uk.other countries use the word `` billion '' ( or words cognate to it ) to denote either the long scale or short scale billion . for details , see long and short scales – current usage . `` milliard '' , another term for one thousand million , is still found occasionally in english , and is very common in most other european languages . for example , bulgarian , catalan , croatian , czech , danish , dutch , finnish , french , georgian , german , hebrew ( asia ) , hungarian , italian , norwegian , polish , portuguese , romanian , russian , serbian , slovak , slovenian , spanish , swedish , turkish and ukrainian — use `` milliard '' ( or a related word ) for the short scale billion , and `` billion '' ( or a related word ) for the long scale billion . thus for these languages `` billion '' is thousand times larger than the modern english billion . however , in russian , while `` milliard '' ( миллиард ) is used for the short scale billion , `` trillion '' ( триллион ) is used for the long scale billion .

pressurized water reactors ( pwrs ) constitute the large majority of the world 's nuclear power plants ( notable exceptions being japan and canada ) and are one of three types of light-water reactor ( lwr ) , the other types being boiling water reactors ( bwrs ) and supercritical water reactors ( scwrs ) . in a pwr , the primary coolant ( water ) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms . the heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers its thermal energy to a secondary system where steam is generated and flows to turbines which , in turn , spin an electric generator . in contrast to a boiling water reactor , pressure in the primary coolant loop prevents the water from boiling within the reactor . all lwrs use ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator . most use anywhere from 2 to 4 vertically mounted steam generators ; vver reactors use horizontal steam generators.pwrs were originally designed to serve as nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines and were used in the original design of the second commercial power plant at shippingport atomic power station.pwrs currently operating in the united states are considered generation ii reactors . russia 's vver reactors are similar to u.s. pwrs . france operates many pwrs to generate the bulk of its electricity .

the water cycle , also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle , describes the continuous movement of water on , above and below the surface of the earth . the mass of water on earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice , fresh water , saline water and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables . the water moves from one reservoir to another , such as from river to ocean , or from the ocean to the atmosphere , by the physical processes of evaporation , condensation , precipitation , infiltration , surface runoff , and subsurface flow . in doing so , the water goes through different forms : liquid , solid ( ice ) and vapor.the water cycle involves the exchange of energy , which leads to temperature changes . when water evaporates , it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment . when it condenses , it releases energy and warms the environment . these heat exchanges influence climate.the evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the land with freshwater . the flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe . it is also involved in reshaping the geological features of the earth , through processes including erosion and sedimentation . the water cycle is also essential for the maintenance of most life and ecosystems on the planet .

a cross-platform interchange is a type of interchange between different lines at a metro ( or other railway ) station . the term originates with the london underground ; such layouts exist in other networks but are not commonly so named . in the united states , it is often referred to as a `` cross-platform transfer '' .this configuration occurs at a station with island platforms , with a single platform in between the tracks allocated to two directions of travel , or two side platforms between the tracks , connected by level corridors . the benefit of this design is that passengers do not need to use stairs to another platform level for transfer , thus increasing the convenience of users . a cross-platform interchange arrangement may be costly due to the complexity of rail alignment , especially if the railway designers also arrange the track with flyovers ( which is typically done to increase efficiency ) . a common two-directions cross-platform interchange configuration consists of two directions of two different lines sharing an island platform , and the respective return directions of both lines sharing a different island platform in the same station complex . much rarer is a cross-platform interchange to transfer onto the same line as in kirkby and ormskirk .

chromatophores are pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells , or groups of cells , found in a wide range of animals including amphibians , fish , reptiles , crustaceans and cephalopods . mammals and birds , in contrast , have a class of cells called melanocytes for coloration.chromatophores are largely responsible for generating skin and eye colour in ectothermic animals and are generated in the neural crest during embryonic development . mature chromatophores are grouped into subclasses based on their colour ( more properly `` hue '' ) under white light : xanthophores ( yellow ) , erythrophores ( red ) , iridophores ( reflective / iridescent ) , leucophores ( white ) , melanophores ( black/brown ) , and cyanophores ( blue ) .some species can rapidly change colour through mechanisms that translocate pigment and reorient reflective plates within chromatophores . this process , often used as a type of camouflage , is called physiological colour change or metachrosis . cephalopods such as the octopus have complex chromatophore organs controlled by muscles to achieve this , whereas vertebrates such as chameleons generate a similar effect by cell signalling . such signals can be hormones or neurotransmitters and may be initiated by changes in mood , temperature , stress or visible changes in the local environment . chromatophores are studied by scientists to understand human disease and as a tool in drug discovery .

beta blockers ( beta-blockers , β-blockers , etc . ) are a class of medications that are predominantly used to manage abnormal heart rhythms , and to protect the heart from a second heart attack ( myocardial infarction ) after a first heart attack ( secondary prevention ) . they are also widely used to treat high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients.beta blockers are competitive antagonists that block the receptor sites for the endogenous catecholamines epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) on adrenergic beta receptors , of the sympathetic nervous system , which mediates the fight-or-flight response . some block activation of all types of β-adrenergic receptors and others are selective for one of the three known types of beta receptors , designated β , β and β receptors . β-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the heart and in the kidneys . β-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs , gastrointestinal tract , liver , uterus , vascular smooth muscle , and skeletal muscle . β-adrenergic receptors are located in fat cells.beta receptors are found on cells of the heart muscles , smooth muscles , airways , arteries , kidneys , and other tissues that are part of the sympathetic nervous system and lead to stress responses , especially when they are stimulated by epinephrine ( adrenaline ) . beta blockers interfere with the binding to the receptor of epinephrine and other stress hormones , and weaken the effects of stress hormones.in 1964 , james black synthesized the first clinically significant beta blockers—propranolol and pronethalol ; it revolutionized the medical management of angina pectoris and is considered by many to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century.for the treatment of primary hypertension , meta-analyses of studies which mostly used atenolol have shown that although beta blockers are more effective than placebo in preventing stroke and total cardiovascular events , they are not as effective as diuretics , medications inhibiting the renin–angiotensin system ( e.g. , ace inhibitors ) , or calcium channel blockers .

a solar flare is a sudden flash of increased brightness on the sun , usually observed near its surfaceand in close proximity to a sunspot group.powerful flares are often , but not always , accompanied by a coronal mass ejection . even the most powerful flares are barely detectable in the total solar irradiance ( the `` solar constant '' ) .solar flares occur in a power-law spectrum of magnitudes ; an energy release of typically 10 joules of energy suffices to produce a clearly observable event , while a major event can emit up to 10 joules.flares are closely associated with the ejection of plasmas and particles through the sun 's corona into outer space ; flares also copiously emit radio waves.if the ejection is in the direction of the earth , particles associated with this disturbance can penetrate into the upper atmosphere ( the ionosphere ) and cause bright auroras , and may even disrupt long range radio communication.it usually takes days for the solar plasma ejecta to reach earth . flares also occur on other stars , where the term stellar flare applies.high-energy particles , which may be relativistic , can arrive almost simultaneously with the electromagnetic radiations .

cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm . people may have few or no symptoms for years . in some cases , particularly in asia , solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin . after months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then resolve . a specific form called neurocysticercosis , which affects the brain , can cause neurological symptoms . in developing countries this is one of the most common causes of seizures.cysticercosis is usually acquired by eating food or drinking water contaminated by tapeworm eggs from human feces . among foods , uncooked vegetables are the major source . the tapeworm eggs are present in the feces of a person infected with the adult worms , a condition known as taeniasis . taeniasis , in the strict sense , is a different disease and is due to eating cysts in poorly cooked pork . people who live with someone with the pork tapeworm have a greater risk of getting cysticercosis . the diagnosis can be made by aspiration of a cyst . taking pictures of the brain with computer tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) are most useful for the diagnosis of disease in the brain . an increased number of a type of white blood cell , called eosinophils , in the cerebral spinal fluid and blood is also an indicator.infection can be effectively prevented by personal hygiene and sanitation : this includes cooking pork well , proper toilets and sanitary practices , and improved access to clean water . treating those with taeniasis is important to prevent spread . treating the disease when it does not involve the nervous system may not be required . treatment of those with neurocysticercosis may be with the medications praziquantel or albendazole . these may be required for long periods of time . steroids , for anti-inflammation during treatment , and anti-seizure medications may also be required . surgery is sometimes done to remove the cysts.the pork tapeworm is particularly common in asia , sub-saharan africa , and latin america . in some areas it is believed that up to 25 % of people are affected . in the developed world it is very uncommon . worldwide in 2015 it caused about 400 deaths . cysticercosis also affects pigs and cows but rarely causes symptoms as most are slaughtered before symptoms arise . the disease has occurred in humans throughout history . it is one of the neglected tropical diseases .

a series of unfortunate events is a series of thirteen novels written by american author daniel handler under the pen name lemony snicket . although they are classified `` children 's novels '' , the books often have a dark , mysterious feeling to them . the books follow the turbulent lives of violet , klaus , and sunny baudelaire . after their parents ' death in a fire , the children are placed in the custody of a murderous relative , count olaf , who attempts to steal their inheritance and , later , orchestrates numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee . as the plot progresses , the baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society known as v.f.d. , with connections to olaf , their parents , and many other relatives . the series is narrated by lemony snicket , who dedicates each of his works to his deceased love interest , beatrice , and often attempts to dissuade the reader from reading the baudelaires ' story.characterized by victorian gothic tones and absurdist textuality , the books are noted for their dark humor , sarcastic storytelling , and anachronistic elements , as well as frequent cultural and literary allusions . they have been classified as postmodern and metafictional writing , with the plot evolution throughout the later novels being cited as an exploration of the psychological process of transition from the idyllic innocence of childhood to the moral complexity of maturity . likewise , the final installments of the series are also acknowledged for their escalatingly intricate ethical ambiguity toward philosophical ambivalence , as the nature of some of the baudelaires ' actions becomes increasingly harder to discern from those of their antagonist counterparts and more characters are revealed to be responsible for permanent wrongdoing , despite their identification with the self-proclaimed good side of the tale.since the release of the first novel , `` the bad beginning '' , in september 1999 , the books have gained significant popularity , critical acclaim , and commercial success worldwide , spawning a film , a video game , assorted merchandise and a television series on netflix . the main thirteen books in the series have collectively sold more than 60 million copies and have been translated into 41 languages . several companion books set in the same universe of the series have also been released , including `` '' , `` the beatrice letters '' and the noir prequel tetralogy `` all the wrong questions '' , which chronicles snicket 's childhood .

ramayana ( ; , rāmāyaṇam ) is one of the two major sanskrit epics of ancient india , the other being the `` mahābhārata '' . along with the `` mahābhārata '' , it forms the hindu itihasa.the epic , traditionally ascribed to the maharishi valmiki , narrates the life of rama , the legendary kosala kingdom . it follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest by his father king dasharatha , on request of his step-mother kaikeyi , his travels across forests in india with his wife sita and brother lakshmana , the kidnapping of his wife by ravana , the great king of lanka , resulting in a war with him and ram 's eventual return to ayodhya to be crowned king . this is the culmination point of the epic . it is considered a sacred book , and is read by millions of people every year.there have been many attempts to unravel the epic 's historical growth and compositional layers ; various recent scholars ' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries bce , with later stages extending up to the 3rd century ce.the `` ramayana '' is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature . it consists of nearly 24,000 verses ( mostly set in the shloka/anustubh meter ) , divided into six `` kāṇḍa '' s : the bālakāṇḍa , the ayodhyakāṇḍa , the araṇyakāṇḍa , the kiṣkindakāṇḍa , the sundarākāṇḍa , and the laṅkākāṇḍa . and about 500 sargas ( chapters ) .the uttarākāṇḍa , although frequently counted among the main ones , is not a part of the original epic . in hindu tradition , the ramayana is considered to be the `` adi-kavya '' ( first poem ) . it depicts the duties of relationships , portraying ideal characters like the ideal father , the ideal servant , the ideal brother , the ideal husband and the ideal king . the `` ramayana '' was an important influence on later sanskrit poetry and hindu life and culture.like `` mahabharata '' , `` ramayana '' presents the teachings of ancient hindu sages in narrative allegory , interspersing philosophical and ethical elements . the characters rama , sita , lakshmana , bharata , hanuman , and ravana are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of the south asian nations of india , nepal , sri lanka and the south-east asian countries of thailand , cambodia , malaysia and indonesia.there are many versions of `` ramayana '' in indian languages , besides buddhist , sikh , and jain adaptations . there are also cambodian , indonesian , filipino , thai , lao , burmese and malaysian versions of the tale . 
bit-level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size . increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word . ( for example , consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers . the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer , then add the 8 higher-order bits , requiring two instructions to complete a single operation . a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction . ) originally , all electronic computers were serial ( single-bit ) computers . the first electronic computer that was not a serial computer—the first bit-parallel computer—was the 16-bit whirlwind from 1951.from the advent of very-large-scale integration ( vlsi ) computer chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986 , advancements in computer architecture were done by increasing bit-level parallelism , as 4-bit microprocessors were replaced by 8-bit , then 16-bit , then 32-bit microprocessors . this trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors , which were a standard in general purpose computing for two decades . 64 bit architectures were introduced to the mainstream with the eponymous nintendo 64 ( 1996 ) , but beyond this introduction stayed uncommon until the advent of x86-64 architectures around the year 2003 , and 2014 for mobile devices with the armv8-a instruction set.on 32-bit processors , external data bus width continues to increase . for example , ddr1 sdram transfers 128 bits per clock cycle . ddr2 sdram transfers a minimum of 256 bits per burst .

the lieutenant governor of massachusetts is the first in the line to discharge the powers and duties of the office of governor following the incapacitation of the governor of massachusetts . the constitutional honorific title for the office is his , or her , honor.the massachusetts constitution provides that when a governor dies , resigns , or is removed from office , the office of governor remains vacant for the rest of the 4-year term . the lieutenant governor discharges powers and duties as `` acting governor '' and does not actually assume the office of governor . the first time this came into use was five years after the constitution 's adoption in 1785 , when governor john hancock resigned his post five months before the election and inauguration of his successor , james bowdoin , leaving lieutenant governor thomas cushing as acting governor . most recently , jane swift became acting governor when paul cellucci resigned in 2001 to become the u.s . ambassador to canada.the lieutenant governor serves in place of the governor when he or she is outside the borders of massachusetts . historically a one-year term , the office of lieutenant governor now carries a four-year term , the same as that of the governor . the lieutenant governor is not elected independently , but on a ticket with the governor . the 1780 constitution required a candidate for either office to have lived in massachusetts for at least seven years immediately preceding election , own at least £1,000 worth of real property and to `` declare himself to be of the christian religion '' . however , only the residency requirement remains in effect , and both men and women have served in the office . amendment article lxiv ( 1918 ) changed the election from every year to every two years , and amendment article lxxxii ( 1966 ) changed it again to every four years . the office is currently held by karyn polito , who was inaugurated in january 2015 .

bolton ( , locally ) is a large town in greater manchester in north west england , historically and traditionally a part of lancashire county . a former mill town , bolton has been a production centre for textiles since flemish weavers settled in the area in the 14th century , introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition . the urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the industrial revolution . bolton was a 19th-century boomtown and , at its zenith in 1929 , its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world . the british cotton industry declined sharply after the first world war and , by the 1980s , cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in bolton.close to the west pennine moors , bolton is north-west of manchester . it is surrounded by several smaller towns and villages that together form the metropolitan borough of bolton , of which bolton is the administrative centre . the town of bolton has a population of 139,403 , whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400 . bolton originated as a small settlement in the moorland known as bolton le moors . in the english civil war , the town was a parliamentarian outpost in a staunchly royalist region and , as a result , was stormed by 3,000 royalist troops led by prince rupert of the rhine in 1644 . in what became known as the bolton massacre , 1,600 residents were killed and 700 were taken prisoner.bolton wanderers football club play home games at the university of bolton stadium and the wba world light-welterweight champion amir khan was born in the town . cultural interests include the octagon theatre and the bolton museum and art gallery , as well as one of the earliest public libraries established after the public libraries act 1850 .

in canada , the indian residential school system was a network of boarding schools for indigenous peoples . the network was funded by the canadian government 's department of indian affairs and administered by christian churches . the school system was created for the purpose of removing indigenous children from the influence of their own culture and assimilating them into the dominant canadian culture , `` to kill the indian in the child . '' over the course of the system 's more than hundred-year existence , about 30 percent of indigenous children ( around 150,000 ) were placed in residential schools nationally . the number of school-related deaths remains unknown due to an incomplete historical record , though estimates range from 3,200 to upwards of 6,000.the system had its origins in laws enacted before confederation , but it was primarily active from the passage of the `` indian act '' in 1876 . an amendment to the `` indian act '' in 1894 made attendance at day schools , industrial schools , or residential schools compulsory for first nations children . due to the remote nature of many communities , school locations meant that for some families , residential schools were the only way to comply . the schools were intentionally located at substantial distances from indigenous communities to minimize contact between families and their children . indian commissioner hayter reed argued for schools at greater distances to reduce family visits , which he thought counteracted efforts to civilize indigenous children . parental visits were further restricted by the use of a pass system designed to confine indigenous peoples to reserves . the last federally operated residential school closed in 1996 , called gordon 's indian residential school and was located in punnichy , saskatchewan . schools operated in every province and territory with the exception of new brunswick and prince edward island.the residential school system harmed indigenous children significantly by removing them from their families , depriving them of their ancestral languages , exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse , and forcibly enfranchising them . disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak english or french , students who attended the residential school system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities and still subject to racist attitudes in mainstream canadian society . the system ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of indigenous practices and beliefs across generations . the legacy of the system has been linked to an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress , alcoholism , substance abuse , and suicide , which persist within indigenous communities today.on june 11 , 2008 , prime minister stephen harper offered a public apology on behalf of the government of canada and the leaders of the other federal parties in the house of commons . nine days prior , the truth and reconciliation commission ( trc ) was established to uncover the truth about the schools . the commission gathered about 7,000 statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local , regional and national events across canada . seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools . in 2015 , the trc concluded with the establishment of the national centre for truth and reconciliation , and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time . the trc report concluded that the school system amounted to cultural genocide .

george pickingill ( c. 1816 – 10 april 1909 ) was an english farm labourer who lived and worked in the village of canewdon in the eastern english county of essex . widely considered to be a cunning man , or vocational folk magician , he reportedly employed magical means to offer cures for ailments and to locate lost property , although was also alleged to have threatened to place curses on people.born into a rural working-class family , pickingill grew up in hockley , essex and was baptised into the church of england . working as a farm labourer , in 1856 he married sarah ann bateman in gravesend , kent . the couple moved back to essex , settled in canewdon and had four children . pickingill 's wife died in 1887 , and in later life he attracted limited press attention for his claim to be one of the oldest men in england . these claims also appeared in his obituaries , although were later shown to be incorrect.pickingill was brought to wider public attention in the early 1960s by the folklorist eric maple . as part of his research into beliefs regarding folk magic and witchcraft in nineteenth-century essex , maple had interviewed a number of canewdon residents and collected their stories about pickingill and his reputation as a cunning man . according to their accounts , pickingill attracted visitors from around essex seeking his magical help , for which he did not charge . they attributed to him the power to control animals , to command imps to do his bidding , and to wield power over either six or nine malevolent witches who lived in canewdon . it was also claimed that he was able to coerce assistance and beer from local residents by threatening to place a curse upon them or their belongings . although it has been suggested that local people were inventing claims to please maple , many of which were based on older tales regarding the essex cunning man james murrell , subsequent research by historian ronald hutton has confirmed aspects of the folklorist 's original accounts.in the 1970s , the occultist e.w . `` bill '' liddell began publicising claims that secretive hereditary witch families had informed him that pickingill was not simply a rural cunning man but that he was a major figure in the nineteenth-century esoteric community . according to liddell 's account—which has failed to receive any scholarly support—pickingill was a member of a hereditary witch-cult , leading a canewdon coven and forming nine other covens across southern england . liddell claimed that pickingill reformed the established english witch-cult by introducing new concepts from french and danish witchcraft and from classical sources , and that in doing so , pickingill created the structure from which gardnerian wicca emerged in the 1950s . prominent wiccans doreen valiente and lois bourne have expressed criticism of his claims , which have also been rejected as spurious by such historians and scholars of religion as maple , hutton , owen davies , and aidan a. kelly .

bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells . this takes place through a pilus.it is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.classical `` e. coli '' bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction or mating since it involves the exchange of genetic material . however , it is not sexual reproduction , since no exchange of gamete occurs , and indeed no generation of a new organism : instead an existing organism is transformed . during classical `` e. coli '' conjugation the `` donor '' cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon . most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the `` recipient '' cell does not already contain a similar element.the genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient . benefits may include antibiotic resistance , xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites.. others elements can be detrimental and may be viewed as bacterial parasites.conjugation in `` escherichia coli '' by spontaneous zygogenesis and in `` mycobacterium smegmatis '' by distributive conjugal transfer differ from the more well studied classical `` e. coli '' conjugation in that these cases involve substantial blending of the parental genomes .

arnold schoenberg or schönberg ( , ; ; 13 september 187413 july 1951 ) was an austrian-born composer , music theorist , teacher , writer , and painter . he is widely considered one of the most influential composers of the 20th century . he was associated with the expressionist movement in german poetry and art , and leader of the second viennese school . with the rise of the nazi party , schoenberg 's works were labeled degenerate music , because they were modernist and atonal . he emigrated to the united states in 1933 , becoming an american citizen in 1941.schoenberg 's approach , bοth in terms of harmony and development , has shaped much of the 20th-century musical thought . many european and american composers from at least three generations have consciously extended his thinking , whereas others have passionately reacted against it.schoenberg was known early in his career for simultaneously extending the traditionally opposed german romantic styles of brahms and wagner . later , his name would come to personify innovations in atonality ( although schoenberg himself detested that term ) that would become the most polemical feature of 20th-century art music . in the 1920s , schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique , an influential compositional method of manipulating an ordered series of all twelve notes in the chromatic scale . he also coined the term developing variation and was the first modern composer to embrace ways of developing motifs without resorting to the dominance of a centralized melodic idea.schoenberg was also an influential teacher of composition ; his students included alban berg , anton webern , hanns eisler , egon wellesz , nikos skalkottas , stefania turkewich , and later john cage , lou harrison , earl kim , robert gerhard , leon kirchner , dika newlin , and . many of schoenberg 's practices , including the formalization of compositional method and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically , are echoed in avant-garde musical thought throughout the 20th century . his often polemical views of music history and aesthetics were crucial to many significant 20th-century musicologists and critics , including theodor w. adorno , charles rosen , and carl dahlhaus , as well as the pianists artur schnabel , rudolf serkin , eduard steuermann , and glenn gould.schoenberg 's archival legacy is collected at the arnold schönberg center in vienna .

the battle of bannockburn ( or ) on 23 and 24 june 1314 was a victory of the army of king of scots robert the bruce over the army of king edward ii of england in the first war of scottish independence . although it did not bring an end to the war , victory would only be secured 14 years later , bannockburn is still a landmark in scottish history.king edward invaded scotland after bruce demanded in 1313 that all supporters still loyal to ousted scottish king john balliol acknowledge bruce as their king or lose their lands . stirling castle , a scots royal fortress occupied by the english , was under siege by the scottish army . king edward assembled a formidable force of soldiers from england , ireland and wales to relieve it – the largest army ever to invade scotland . this attempt failed when he found his path blocked by a smaller army commanded by bruce.the scottish army was divided into three divisions of schiltrons commanded by bruce , his brother edward bruce , and his nephew , the earl of moray . after robert bruce killed sir henry de bohun on the first day of the battle , the english were forced to withdraw for the night . sir alexander seton , a scottish noble serving in edward 's army , defected to the scottish side and informed them of the english camp 's position and low morale . robert bruce decided to launch a full-scale attack on the english forces and to use his schiltrons again as offensive units , a strategy his predecessor william wallace had not used . the english army was defeated in a pitched battle which resulted in the deaths of several prominent commanders , including the earl of gloucester and sir robert clifford , and capture of many others.the victory against the english at bannockburn is the most celebrated in scottish history , and for centuries the battle has been commemorated in verse and art . the national trust for scotland operates the bannockburn visitor centre ( previously known as the bannockburn heritage centre ) . though the exact location for the battle is uncertain , a modern monument was erected in a field above a possible site of the battlefield , where the warring parties are believed to have camped , alongside a statue of robert bruce designed by pilkington jackson . the monument , along with the associated visitor centre , is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area .

in linguistics , transitivity is a property of verbs that relates to whether a verb can take direct objects and how many such objects a verb can take . it is closely related to valency , which considers other verb arguments in addition to direct objects . the obligatory noun phrases and prepositional phrases determine how many arguments a predicate has . obligatory elements are considered arguments while optional ones are never counted in the list of arguments.traditional grammar makes a binary distinction between intransitive verbs that can not take a direct object ( such as `` fall '' or `` sit '' in english ) and transitive verbs that take one direct object ( such as `` throw '' , `` injure '' , `` kiss '' in english ) . in practice , many languages ( including english ) interpret the category more flexibly , allowing : ditransitive verbs , verbs that have two objects ; or even ambitransitive verbs , verbs that can be used as both a transitive verb and an intransitive verb . further , some verbs may be idiomatically transitive , while , technically , intransitive . this may be observed in the verb `` walk '' in the idiomatic expression `` to walk the dog '' .in functional grammar , transitivity is considered to be a `` continuum '' rather than a binary category as in traditional grammar . the `` continuum '' view takes a more semantic approach . one way it does this is by taking into account the degree to which an action affects its object ( so that the verb `` see '' is described as having `` lower transitivity '' than the verb `` kill '' ) .

zionism ( `` tsiyyonut '' after `` zion '' ) is both an ideology and nationalist movement among the jewish people that espouses the re-establishment of and support for a jewish state in the territory defined as the historic land of israel ( roughly corresponding to canaan , the holy land , or the region of palestine ) . modern zionism emerged in the late 19th century in central and eastern europe as a national revival movement , both in reaction to newer waves of antisemitism and as a response to haskalah , or jewish enlightenment . soon after this , most leaders of the movement associated the main goal with creating the desired state in palestine , then an area controlled by the ottoman empire.until 1948 , the primary goals of zionism were the re-establishment of jewish sovereignty in the land of israel , in gathering of the exiles , and liberation of jews from the antisemitic discrimination and persecution that they experienced during their diaspora . since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948 , zionism continues primarily to advocate on behalf of israel and to address threats to its continued existence and security.a religious variety of zionism supports jews upholding their jewish identity defined as adherence to religious judaism , opposes the assimilation of jews into other societies , and has advocated the return of jews to israel as a means for jews to be a majority nation in their own state . a variety of zionism , called cultural zionism , founded and represented most prominently by ahad ha'am , fostered a secular vision of a jewish `` spiritual center '' in israel . unlike herzl , the founder of political zionism , ahad ha'am strived for israel to be `` a jewish state and not merely a state of jews '' .advocates of zionism view it as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of a persecuted people residing as minorities in a variety of nations to their ancestral homeland . critics of zionism view it as a colonialist , racist and exceptionalist ideology that led advocates to violence during mandatory palestine , followed by the exodus of palestinians , and the subsequent denial of their right to return to lands and property lost during the 1948 and 1967 wars .

trickle-down economics , also called trickle-down theory , refers to the economic proposition that taxes on businesses and the wealthy in society should be reduced as a means to stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term . in recent history , the term has been used by critics of supply-side economic policies , such as `` reaganomics '' . whereas general supply-side theory favors lowering taxes overall , trickle-down theory more specifically targets taxes on the upper end of the economic spectrum.the term `` trickle-down '' originated as a joke by humorist will rogers and today is often used to criticize economic policies that favor the wealthy or privileged while being framed as good for the average citizen . david stockman , who as ronald reagan 's budget director championed reagan 's tax cuts at first , later became critical of them and told journalist william greider that `` supply-side economics '' is the trickle-down idea : political opponents of the reagan administration soon seized on this language in an effort to brand the administration as caring only about the wealthy . some studies suggest a link between trickle-down economics and reduced growth . trickle-down economics has been widely criticized , particularly by left-wing , centre-left and moderate politicians and economists , but also some right-wing politicians . 
pelvic inflammatory disease , also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder ( pid ) , is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system , namely the uterus , fallopian tubes , and ovaries , and inside of the pelvis . often , there may be no symptoms . signs and symptoms , when present , may include lower abdominal pain , vaginal discharge , fever , burning with urination , pain with sex , bleeding after sex , or irregular menstruation . untreated pid can result in long-term complications including infertility , ectopic pregnancy , chronic pelvic pain , and cancer.the disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix . infections by `` neisseria gonorrhoeae '' or `` chlamydia trachomatis '' are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases . often , multiple different bacteria are involved . without treatment , about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop pid . risk factors are generally similar to those of sexually transmitted infections and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use . vaginal douching may also increase the risk . the diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms . it is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain . a definitive diagnosis of pid is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery . ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.efforts to prevent the disease include not having sex or having few sexual partners and using condoms . screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of pid . if the diagnosis is suspected , treatment is typically advised . treating a woman 's sexual partners should also occur . in those with mild or moderate symptoms , a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended . for those who do not improve after three days or who have severe disease , intravenous antibiotics should be used.globally , about 106 million cases of chlamydia and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008 . the number of cases of pid , however , is not clear . it is estimated to affect about 1.5 percent of young women yearly . in the united states , pid is estimated to affect about one million people each year . a type of intrauterine device ( iud ) known as the dalkon shield led to increased rates of pid in the 1970s . current iuds are not associated with this problem after the first month .

nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol n and atomic number 7 . it was first discovered and isolated by scottish physician daniel rutherford in 1772 . although carl wilhelm scheele and henry cavendish had independently done so at about the same time , rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first . the name `` nitrogène '' was suggested by french chemist jean-antoine-claude chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates . antoine lavoisier suggested instead the name `` azote '' , from the greek ἀζωτικός `` no life '' , as it is an asphyxiant gas ; this name is instead used in many languages , such as french , italian , russian , romanian and turkish , and appears in the english names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine , azides and azo compounds.nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table , often called the pnictogens . it is a common element in the universe , estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the milky way and the solar system . at standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dinitrogen , a colourless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula n. dinitrogen forms about 78 % of earth 's atmosphere , making it the most abundant uncombined element . nitrogen occurs in all organisms , primarily in amino acids ( and thus proteins ) , in the nucleic acids ( dna and rna ) and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate . the human body contains about 3 % nitrogen by mass , the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen , carbon , and hydrogen . the nitrogen cycle describes movement of the element from the air , into the biosphere and organic compounds , then back into the atmosphere.many industrially important compounds , such as ammonia , nitric acid , organic nitrates ( propellants and explosives ) , and cyanides , contain nitrogen . the extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen ( n≡n ) , the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide ( co ) , dominates nitrogen chemistry . this causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting n into useful compounds , but at the same time means that burning , exploding , or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy . synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers , and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.apart from its use in fertilisers and energy-stores , nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue . nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class , including antibiotics . many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules : for example , the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide . many notable nitrogen-containing drugs , such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines , act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters . 
aldous leonard huxley ( 26 july 1894 – 22 november 1963 ) was an english writer and philosopher . he wrote nearly fifty books—both novels and non-fiction works—as well as wide-ranging essays , narratives , and poems.born into the prominent huxley family , he graduated from balliol college , oxford with an undergraduate degree in english literature . early in his career , he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine `` oxford poetry '' , before going on to publish travel writing , satire , and screenplays . he spent the latter part of his life in the united states , living in los angeles from 1937 until his death . by the end of his life , huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time . he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature seven times and was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature in 1962.huxley was a pacifist . he grew interested in philosophical mysticism and universalism , addressing these subjects with works such as `` the perennial philosophy '' ( 1945 ) —which illustrates commonalities between western and eastern mysticism—and `` the doors of perception '' ( 1954 ) —which interprets his own psychedelic experience with mescaline . in his most famous novel `` brave new world '' ( 1932 ) and his final novel `` island '' ( 1962 ) , he presented his vision of dystopia and utopia , respectively . 
in chemistry , a phosphate is an anion , salt , functional group or ester derived from a phosphoric acid . it most commonly means orthophosphate , a derivative of orthophosphoric acid .the phosphate or orthophosphate ion is derived from phosphoric acid by the removal of three protons . removal of one or two protons gives the dihydrogen phosphate ion and the hydrogen phosphate ion ion , respectively . these names are also used for salts of those anions , such as ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and trisodium phosphate.in organic chemistry , phosphate or orthophosphate is an organophosphate , an ester of orthophosphoric acid of the form where one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by organic groups . an example is trimethyl phosphate , . the term also refers to the trivalent functional group in such esters.orthophosphates are especially important among the various phosphates because of their key roles in biochemistry , biogeochemistry , and ecology , and their economic importance for agriculture and industry . the addition and removal of phosphate groups ( phosphorylation and dephosphorylation ) are key steps in cell metabolism.orthophosphates can condense to form pyrophosphates .

nicola sacco ( ; april 22 , 1891 – august 23 , 1927 ) and bartolomeo vanzetti ( ; june 11 , 1888 – august 23 , 1927 ) were two italian immigrant anarchists who were controversially convicted of murdering a guard and a paymaster during the april 15 , 1920 , armed robbery of the slater and morrill shoe company in braintree , massachusetts , united states . seven years later , they were electrocuted in the electric chair at charlestown state prison . both men adhered to an anarchist movement.after a few hours ' deliberation on july 14 , 1921 , the jury convicted sacco and vanzetti of first-degree murder and they were sentenced to death by the trial judge . anti-italianism , anti-immigrant , and anti-anarchist bias were suspected as having heavily influenced the verdict . a series of appeals followed , funded largely by the private sacco and vanzetti defense committee . the appeals were based on recanted testimony , conflicting ballistics evidence , a prejudicial pretrial statement by the jury foreman , and a confession by an alleged participant in the robbery . all appeals were denied by trial judge webster thayer and also later denied by the massachusetts supreme judicial court . by 1926 , the case had drawn worldwide attention . as details of the trial and the men 's suspected innocence became known , sacco and vanzetti became the center of one of the largest causes célèbres in modern history . in 1927 , protests on their behalf were held in every major city in north america and europe , as well as in tokyo , sydney , melbourne , são paulo , rio de janeiro , buenos aires , dubai , montevideo , johannesburg , and auckland.celebrated writers , artists , and academics pleaded for their pardon or for a new trial . harvard law professor and future supreme court justice felix frankfurter argued for their innocence in a widely read `` atlantic monthly '' article that was later published in book form . the two were scheduled to die in april 1927 , accelerating the outcry . responding to a massive influx of telegrams urging their pardon , massachusetts governor alvan t. fuller appointed a three-man commission to investigate the case . after weeks of secret deliberation that included interviews with the judge , lawyers , and several witnesses , the commission upheld the verdict . sacco and vanzetti were executed in the electric chair just after midnight on august 23 , 1927 . subsequent riots destroyed property in paris , london , and other cities.investigations in the aftermath of the executions continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s . the publication of the men 's letters , containing eloquent professions of innocence , intensified belief in their wrongful execution . additional ballistics tests and incriminating statements by the men 's acquaintances have clouded the case . on august 23 , 1977—the 50th anniversary of the executions—massachusetts governor michael dukakis issued a proclamation that sacco and vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that `` any disgrace should be forever removed from their names '' . 
third normal form ( 3nf ) is a database schema design approach for relational databases which uses normalizing principles to reduce the duplication of data , avoid data anomalies , ensure referential integrity , and simplify data management . it was defined in 1971 by edgar f. codd , an english computer scientist who invented the relational model for database management.a database relation ( e.g . a database table ) is said to meet third normal form standards if all the attributes ( e.g . database columns ) are functionally dependent on solely the primary key . codd defined this as a relation in second normal form where all non-prime attributes depend only on the candidate keys and do not have a transitive dependency on another key.a hypothetical example of a failure to meet third normal form would be a hospital database having a table of patients which included a column for the telephone number of their doctor . the phone number is dependent on the doctor , rather than the patient , thus would be better stored in a table of doctors . the negative outcome of such a design is that a doctor 's number will be duplicated in the database if they have multiple patients , thus increasing both the chance of input error and the cost and risk of updating that number should it change ( compared to a third normal form-compliant data model that only stores a doctor 's number once on a doctor table ) .codd later realized that 3nf did not eliminate all undesirable data anomalies and developed a stronger version to address this in 1974 , known as boyce–codd normal form .

gothic architecture ( or pointed architecture ) is an architectural style that flourished in europe during the high and late middle ages . it evolved from romanesque architecture and was succeeded by renaissance architecture . it originated in 12th-century northern france and england as a development of norman architecture . its popularity lasted into the 16th century , before which the style was known as ; the term `` gothic '' was first applied during the later renaissance.the defining element of gothic architecture is the pointed or ogival arch . it is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component . the use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed rib vault and flying buttresses , combined with elaborate tracery and stained glass windows.at the abbey of saint-denis , near paris , the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144 , drawing together for the first time the developing gothic architectural features . in doing so , a new architectural style emerged that internally emphasised verticality in the structural members , and the effect created by the transmission of light through stained glass windows.survivals of medieval gothic architecture are most common as christian ecclesiastical architecture , in the cathedrals , abbeys , and parish churches of europe . it is also the architecture of many castles , palaces , town halls , guildhalls , universities and , less prominently today , private dwellings . many of the finest examples of mediaeval gothic architecture are listed with unesco as world heritage sites.with the development of renaissance architecture in italy during the mid 15th century , the gothic style was supplanted by the new style , but in some regions , notably england , gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century . a series of gothic revivals began in mid-18th century england , spread through 19th-century europe and continued , largely for ecclesiastical and university structures , into the 20th century .

emotions are biological states associated with the nervous system brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts , feelings , behavioural responses , and a degree of pleasure or displeasure . there is currently no scientific consensus on a definition . emotions are often intertwined with mood , temperament , personality , disposition , creativity and motivation.research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades with many fields contributing including psychology , neuroscience , affective neuroscience , endocrinology , medicine , history , sociology of emotions , and computer science . the numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin , neurobiology , experience , and function of emotions have only fostered more intense research on this topic . current areas of research in the concept of emotion include the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion . in addition , pet scans and fmri scans help study the affective picture processes in the brain.from a purely mechanistic perspective , `` emotions can be defined as a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity . '' emotions produce different physiological , behavioral and cognitive changes . the original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the passing on of genes through survival , reproduction , and kin selection.in some theories , cognition is an important aspect of emotion . for those who act primarily on emotions , they may assume that they are not thinking , but mental processes involving cognition are still essential , particularly in the interpretation of events . for example , the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body 's nervous system ( rapid heartbeat and breathing , sweating , muscle tension ) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid . other theories , however , claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition . consciously experiencing an emotion is exhibiting a mental representation of that emotion from a past or hypothetical experience , which is linked back to a content state of pleasure or displeasure . the content states are established by verbal explanations of experiences , describing an internal state.emotions are complex . according to some theories , they are states of feeling that result in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior . the physiology of emotion is closely linked to arousal of the nervous system with various states and strengths of arousal relating , apparently , to particular emotions . emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency . extroverted people are more likely to be social and express their emotions , while introverted people are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal their emotions . emotion is often the driving force behind motivation , positive or negative . according to other theories , emotions are not causal forces but simply syndromes of components , which might include motivation , feeling , behavior , and physiological changes , but no one of these components is the emotion . nor is the emotion an entity that causes these components.emotions involve different components , such as subjective experience , cognitive processes , expressive behavior , psychophysiological changes , and instrumental behavior . at one time , academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components : william james with a subjective experience , behaviorists with instrumental behavior , psychophysiologists with physiological changes , and so on . more recently , emotion is said to consist of all the components . the different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline . in psychology and philosophy , emotion typically includes a subjective , conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions , biological reactions , and mental states . a similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology . for example , peggy thoits described emotions as involving physiological components , cultural or emotional labels ( anger , surprise , etc . ) , expressive body actions , and the appraisal of situations and contexts .

in combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge , the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class . in professional boxing , the lineal champion is informally called `` the man who beat the man '' .champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the world boxing association ( wba ) , world boxing council ( wbc ) , or the ultimate fighting championship ( ufc ) may vacate their title voluntarily , or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body 's regulations or contracts . there will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent . however , there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class , because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class , although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted .

aspergillus ( ) is a genus consisting of a few hundred mould species found in various climates worldwide . `` aspergillus '' was first catalogued in 1729 by the italian priest and biologist pier antonio micheli . viewing the fungi under a microscope , micheli was reminded of the shape of an `` aspergillum '' ( holy water sprinkler ) , from latin `` spargere '' ( to sprinkle ) , and named the genus accordingly . aspergillum is an asexual spore-forming structure common to all `` aspergillus '' species ; around one-third of species are also known to have a sexual stage.aspergillus can be eliminated from homes with the help of either rubbing alcohol ( 70 % ) or by using strong air purifiers to eliminate the effects on the lungs . 
a tank is an armoured fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat . tanks have heavy firepower , strong armour , and good battlefield manoeuvrability provided by tracks and a powerful engine ; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret . they are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.modern tanks are versatile mobile land weapon system platforms that have a mounted large-calibre cannon called tank gun in a rotating gun turret supplemented by mounted machine guns or other weapons such as anti-tank guided missiles or rockets . they have heavy vehicle armour which provides protection for the crew , the vehicle 's weapons and propulsion systems . the use of tracks rather than wheels provides operational mobility which allows the tank to move over rugged terrain and counter adverse conditions such as mud ( and be positioned on the battlefield in advantageous locations ) . these features enable the tank to perform well in a variety of intense combat situations , simultaneously both offensively ( with fire from their powerful tank gun ) and defensively ( due to their near invulnerability to common firearms and good resistance to heavier weapons , all while maintaining the mobility needed to exploit changing tactical situations ) . fully integrating tanks into modern military forces spawned a new era of combat : armoured warfare.there are classes of tanks : some being larger and very heavily armoured and with high calibre guns , while others are smaller , lightly armoured , and equipped with a smaller calibre and lighter gun . these smaller tanks move over terrain with speed and agility and can perform a reconnaissance role in addition to engaging enemy targets . the smaller , faster tank would not normally engage in battle with a larger , heavily armoured tank , except during a surprise flanking manoeuvre . 
the siege of sidney street of january 1911 , also known as the battle of stepney , was a gunfight in the east end of london between a combined police and army force and two latvian revolutionaries . the siege was the culmination of a series of events that began in december 1910 , with an attempted jewellery robbery at houndsditch in the city of london by a gang of latvian immigrants which resulted in the murder of three policemen , the wounding of two others , and the death of george gardstein , the leader of the latvian gang.an investigation by the metropolitan and city of london police forces identified gardstein 's accomplices , most of whom were arrested within two weeks . the police were informed that the last two members of the gang were hiding at 100 sidney street in stepney . the police evacuated local residents from the environs , and on the morning of 3 january a firefight broke out . armed with inferior weapons , the police sought assistance from the army . the siege lasted for about six hours . towards the end of the stand-off , the building caught fire ; no single cause has been identified . one of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire spread . while the london fire brigade were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed , killing a fireman , superintendent charles pearson.the siege marked the first time the police had requested military assistance in london to deal with an armed stand-off . it was also the first siege in britain to be caught on camera , as the events were filmed by pathé news . some of the footage included images of the home secretary , winston churchill . his presence caused a political row over the level of his operational involvement . at the trial in may 1911 of those arrested for the houndsditch jewellery robbery , all but one of the accused were acquitted ; the conviction was overturned on appeal . the events were fictionalised in film—in `` the man who knew too much '' ( 1934 ) and `` the siege of sidney street '' ( 1960 ) —and novels . on the centenary of the events two tower blocks in sidney street were named after peter the painter , one of the minor members of the gang who was probably not present at either houndsditch or sidney street . the murdered policemen and the fireman who died are commemorated with memorial plaques .

anticonvulsants ( also commonly known as antiepileptic drugs or as antiseizure drugs ) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures . anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder , since many seem to act as mood stabilizers , and for the treatment of neuropathic pain . anticonvulsants suppress the excessive rapid firing of neurons during seizures . anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain.conventional antiepileptic drugs may block sodium channels or enhance γ-aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) function . several antiepileptic drugs have multiple or uncertain mechanisms of action . next to the voltage-gated sodium channels and components of the gaba system , their targets include gaba receptors , the gat-1 gaba transporter , and gaba transaminase . additional targets include voltage-gated calcium channels , sv2a , and α2δ . by blocking sodium or calcium channels , antiepileptic drugs reduce the release of excitatory glutamate , whose release is considered to be elevated in epilepsy , but also that of gaba . this is probably a side effect or even the actual mechanism of action for some antiepileptic drugs , since gaba can itself , directly or indirectly , act proconvulsively . another potential target of antiepileptic drugs is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha . the drug class was the fifth-best-selling in the united states in 2007.some anticonvulsants have shown antiepileptogenic effects in animal models of epilepsy . that is , they either prevent the development of epilepsy or can halt or reverse the progression of epilepsy . however , no drug has been shown in human trials to prevent epileptogenesis ( the development of epilepsy in an individual at risk , such as after a head injury ) .

the bonobo ( ; `` pan paniscus '' ) , also historically called the pygmy chimpanzee and less often , the dwarf or gracile chimpanzee , is an endangered great ape and one of the two species making up the genus `` pan '' ; the other being the common chimpanzee ( `` pan troglodytes '' ) . although bonobos are not a subspecies of chimpanzee ( `` pan troglodytes ) '' , but rather a distinct species in their own right , both species are sometimes referred to collectively using the generalized term `` chimpanzees '' , or `` chimps '' . taxonomically , the members of the chimpanzee/bonobo subtribe panina ( comprised entirely by the genus `` pan '' ) are collectively termed `` panins '' .the bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs , pink lips , dark face , tail-tuft through adulthood , and parted long hair on its head . the bonobo is found in a area of the congo basin in the democratic republic of the congo , central africa . the species is omnivorous and inhabits primary and secondary forests , including seasonally inundated swamp forests . because of political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos , there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.along with the common chimpanzee , the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans . as the two species are not proficient swimmers , the formation of the congo river 1.5–2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo . bonobos live south of the river , and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee , which live north of the river . there are no concrete data on population numbers , but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals . the species is listed as endangered on the iucn red list and is threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement , though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat . bonobos typically live 40 years in captivity ; their lifespan in the wild is unknown , but it is almost certainly much shorter .

princess royal is a style customarily ( but not automatically ) awarded by a british monarch to his or her eldest daughter . there have been seven princesses royal . princess anne is the current princess royal . queen elizabeth ii was never known as the princess royal because her aunt , princess mary , was in possession of the title.the style `` princess royal '' came into existence when queen henrietta maria ( 1609–1669 ) , daughter of henry iv , king of france , and wife of king charles i ( 1600–1649 ) , wanted to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the king of france was styled `` madame royale '' . thus princess mary ( born 1631 ) , the daughter of henrietta maria and charles , became the first princess royal in 1642.princess mary ( later queen mary ii ) ( 1662–1694 ) , eldest daughter of king james ii and vii , and princess sophia dorothea ( 1687–1757 ) , only daughter of king george i , were eligible for this honour but did not receive it . at the time she became eligible for the style , princess mary was already princess of orange , while sophia dorothea was already queen in prussia when she became eligible for the style.princess louisa maria ( 1692–1712 ) , the youngest daughter of king james ii ( died 1701 ) , born after he lost his crown in the glorious revolution of 1688–1689 , was considered to be princess royal during james 's exile by jacobites at saint-germain-en-laye and was so called by jacobites , even though she was not james 's eldest living daughter at any time during her life.even before the style of `` princess royal '' came into use in england , the eldest daughter of the king or queen of england had a special status in law . for instance , according to magna carta , the barons of the realm owed aids to finance the first wedding of the king 's eldest daughter , and by a statute of the 25th year of king edward iii , sleeping with the king 's eldest daughter before her marriage constitutes an act of high treason punishable by death .

nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is a physical phenomenon in which nuclei in a strong constant magnetic field are perturbed by a weak oscillating magnetic field ( in the near field ) and respond by producing an electromagnetic signal with a frequency characteristic of the magnetic field at the nucleus . this process occurs near resonance , when the oscillation frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of the nuclei , which depends on the strength of the static magnetic field , the chemical environment , and the magnetic properties of the isotope involved ; in practical applications with static magnetic fields up to ca . 20 tesla , the frequency is similar to vhf and uhf television broadcasts ( 60–1000 mhz ) . nmr results from specific magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei . nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used to determine the structure of organic molecules in solution and study molecular physics , crystals as well as non-crystalline materials . nmr is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques , such as in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .all isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or neutrons ( see isotope ) have an intrinsic nuclear magnetic moment and angular momentum , in other words a nonzero nuclear spin , while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero . the most commonly used nuclei are and , although isotopes of many other elements can be studied by high-field nmr spectroscopy as well.a key feature of nmr is that the resonance frequency of a particular sample substance is usually directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field . it is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques ; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample 's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located . since the resolution of the imaging technique depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field gradient , many efforts are made to develop increased gradient field strength.the principle of nmr usually involves three sequential steps : the two magnetic fields are usually chosen to be perpendicular to each other as this maximizes the nmr signal strength . the frequencies of the time-signal response by the total magnetization ( m ) of the nuclear spins are analyzed in nmr spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging . both use applied magnetic fields ( b ) of great strength , often produced by large currents in superconducting coils , in order to achieve dispersion of response frequencies and of very high homogeneity and stability in order to deliver spectral resolution , the details of which are described by chemical shifts , the zeeman effect , and knight shifts ( in metals ) . the information provided by nmr can also be increased using hyperpolarization , and/or using two-dimensional , three-dimensional and higher-dimensional techniques.nmr phenomena are also utilized in low-field nmr , nmr spectroscopy and mri in the earth 's magnetic field ( referred to as earth 's field nmr ) , and in several types of magnetometers .

apartheid ( south african english : ; , segregation ; lit . `` aparthood '' ) was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in south africa and south west africa ( now namibia ) from 1948 until the early 1990s . apartheid was characterised by an authoritarian political culture based on `` baasskap '' ( or white supremacy ) , which ensured that south africa was dominated politically , socially , and economically by the nation 's minority white population . according to this system of social stratification , white citizens had the highest status , followed by asians and coloureds , then black africans . the economic legacy and social effects of apartheid continue to the present day.broadly speaking , apartheid was delineated into `` petty apartheid '' , which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events , and `` grand apartheid '' , which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race . prior to the 1940s , some aspects of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white south africans and the socially enforced separation of black africans from other races , which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment . apartheid was adopted as a formal policy by the south african government after the ascension of the national party ( np ) during the 1948 general elections.a codified system of racial stratification began to take form in south africa under the dutch empire in the eighteenth century , although informal segregation was present much earlier due to social cleavages between dutch colonists and a creolised , ethnically diverse slave population . with the rapid growth and industrialisation of the british cape colony , racial policies and laws which had previously been relatively relaxed became increasingly rigid , discriminating specifically against black africans , in the last decade of the 19th century . the policies of the boer republics were also racially exclusive ; for instance , the transvaal 's constitution barred black african and coloured participation in church and state.the first apartheid law was the prohibition of mixed marriages act , 1949 , followed closely by the immorality amendment act of 1950 , which made it illegal for most south african citizens to marry or pursue sexual relationships across racial lines . the population registration act , 1950 classified all south africans into one of four racial groups based on appearance , known ancestry , socioeconomic status , and cultural lifestyle : `` black '' , `` white '' , `` coloured '' , and `` indian '' , the last two of which included several sub-classifications . places of residence were determined by racial classification . between 1960 and 1983 , 3.5 million black africans were removed from their homes and forced into segregated neighbourhoods as a result of apartheid legislation , in some of the largest mass evictions in modern history . most of these targeted removals were intended to restrict the black population to ten designated `` tribal homelands '' , also known as `` bantustans '' , four of which became nominally independent states . the government announced that relocated persons would lose their south african citizenship as they were absorbed into the bantustans.apartheid sparked significant international and domestic opposition , resulting in some of the most influential global social movements of the twentieth century . it was the target of frequent condemnation in the united nations and brought about an extensive arms and trade embargo on south africa . during the 1970s and 1980s , internal resistance to apartheid became increasingly militant , prompting brutal crackdowns by the national party government and protracted sectarian violence that left thousands dead or in detention . some reforms of the apartheid system were undertaken , including allowing for indian and coloured political representation in parliament , but these measures failed to appease most activist groups.between 1987 and 1993 , the national party entered into bilateral negotiations with the african national congress ( anc ) , the leading anti-apartheid political movement , for ending segregation and introducing majority rule . in 1990 , prominent anc figures such as nelson mandela were released from prison . apartheid legislation was repealed on 17 june 1991 , pending multiracial elections held under a universal suffrage set for april 1994 .

greek fire was an incendiary weapon used by the byzantine empire beginning . used to set light to enemy ships , it consisted of a combustible compound emitted by a flame-throwing weapon . some historians believe it could be ignited on contact with water , and was probably based on naphtha and quicklime . the byzantines typically used it in naval battles to great effect , as it could continue burning while floating on water . the technological advantage it provided was responsible for many key byzantine military victories , most notably the salvation of constantinople from the first and second arab sieges , thus securing the empire 's survival.the impression made by greek fire on the western european crusaders was such that the name was applied to any sort of incendiary weapon , including those used by arabs , the chinese , and the mongols . however , these mixtures used formulas different from that of byzantine greek fire , which was a closely guarded state secret . byzantines also used pressurized nozzles to project the liquid onto the enemy , in a manner resembling a modern flamethrower.although usage of the term `` greek fire '' has been general in english and most other languages since the crusades , original byzantine sources called the substance a variety of names , such as `` sea fire '' ( medieval greek : ) , `` roman fire '' ( ) , `` war fire '' ( ) , `` liquid fire '' ( ) , `` sticky fire '' ( ) , or `` manufactured fire '' ( ) .the composition of greek fire remains a matter of speculation and debate , with various proposals including combinations of pine resin , naphtha , quicklime , calcium phosphide , sulfur , or niter . in his history of rome , titus livy describes priestesses of bacchus dipping fire into the water , which did not extinguish , `` for it was sulphur mixed with lime .

the kansas–nebraska act of 1854 ( ) was a territorial organic act that created the territories of kansas and nebraska . it was drafted by democratic senator stephen a. douglas , passed by the 33rd united states congress , and signed into law by president franklin pierce . douglas introduced the bill with the goal of opening up new lands to development and facilitating construction of a transcontinental railroad , but the kansas–nebraska act is most notable for effectively repealing the missouri compromise , stoking national tensions over slavery , and contributing to a series of armed conflicts known as `` bleeding kansas '' .the united states had acquired vast amounts of sparsely settled land in the 1803 louisiana purchase , and since the 1840s douglas had sought to establish a territorial government in a portion of the louisiana purchase that was still unorganized . douglas 's efforts were stymied by senator david rice atchison and other southern leaders who refused to allow the creation of territories that banned slavery ; slavery would have been banned because the missouri compromise outlawed slavery in territory north of latitude 36°30 ' north . to win the support of southerners like atchison , pierce and douglas agreed to back the repeal of the missouri compromise , with the status of slavery instead decided on the basis of `` popular sovereignty . '' under popular sovereignty , the citizens of each territory , rather than congress , would determine whether or not slavery would be allowed.douglas 's bill to repeal the missouri compromise and organize kansas territory and nebraska territory won approval by a wide margin in the senate , but faced stronger opposition in the house of representatives . though northern whigs strongly opposed the bill , the bill passed the house with the support of almost all southerners and some northern democrats . after the passage of the act , pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into kansas with the goal of establishing a population that would vote for or against slavery , resulting in a series of armed conflicts known as `` bleeding kansas '' . douglas and pierce hoped that popular sovereignty would help bring an end to the national debate over slavery , but the kansas–nebraska act outraged many northerners , giving rise to the anti-slavery republican party . ongoing tensions over slavery would eventually lead to the american civil war .

a field army ( or numbered army or simply army ) is a military formation in many armed forces , composed of two or more corps and may be subordinate to an army group . likewise , air armies are equivalent formation within some air forces . a field army is composed of 100,000 to 300,000 troops.specific field armies are usually named or numbered to distinguish them from `` army '' in the sense of an entire national land military force . in english , the typical orthographic style for writing out the names field armies is word numbers , such as `` first army '' ; whereas corps are usually distinguished by roman numerals ( e.g . i corps ) and subordinate formations with ordinal numbers ( e.g . 1st division ) . a field army may be given a geographical name in addition to or as an alternative to a numerical name , such as the british army of the rhine , army of the niemen or aegean army ( also known as the fourth army ) .the roman army was among the first to feature a formal field army , in the sense of a very large , combined arms formation , namely the `` sacer comitatus '' , which may be translated literally as `` sacred escort '' . the term is derived from the fact that they were commanded by roman emperors ( who were regarded as sacred ) , when they acted as field commanders . while the roman `` comitatensis '' ( plural : `` comitatenses '' ) is sometimes translated as `` field army '' , it may also be translated as the more generic `` field force '' or `` mobile force '' ( as opposed to `` limitanei '' or garrison units ) .in some armed forces , an `` army '' is or has been equivalent to a corps-level unit . prior to 1945 , this was the case with a `` gun '' ( 軍 ; `` army '' ) within the imperial japanese army , for which the formation equivalent in size to a field army was an `` area army '' ( 方面軍 ; `` hōmen-gun '' ) . in the soviet red army and the soviet air forces , an army was subordinate in wartime to a front ( an equivalent of army group ) . it contained at least three to five divisions along with artillery , air defense , reconnaissance and other supporting units . it could be classified as either a combined arms army ( caa ) or tank army ( ta ) ; and while both were combined arms formations , the former contained a larger number of motorized rifle divisions while the later contained a larger number of tank divisions . in peacetime , a soviet army was usually subordinate to a military district.modern field armies are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size , composition , and scope of responsibility . for instance , within nato a field army is composed of a headquarters , and usually controls at least two corps , beneath which are a variable number of divisions . a battle is influenced at the field army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point . nato armies are commanded by a general or lieutenant general .

pindar ( ; , ; ; c. 518 – 438 bc ) was an ancient greek lyric poet from thebes . of the canonical nine lyric poets of ancient greece , his work is the best preserved . quintilian wrote , `` of the nine lyric poets , pindar is by far the greatest , in virtue of his inspired magnificence , the beauty of his thoughts and figures , the rich exuberance of his language and matter , and his rolling flood of eloquence , characteristics which , as horace rightly held , make him inimitable . '' his poems can also , however , seem difficult and even peculiar . the athenian comic playwright eupolis once remarked that they `` are already reduced to silence by the disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning '' . some scholars in the modern age also found his poetry perplexing , at least until the 1896 discovery of some poems by his rival bacchylides ; comparisons of their work showed that many of pindar 's idiosyncrasies are typical of archaic genres rather than of only the poet himself . his poetry , while admired by critics , still challenges the casual reader and his work is largely unread among the general public.pindar was the first greek poet to reflect on the nature of poetry and on the poet 's role . like other poets of the archaic age , he has a profound sense of the vicissitudes of life , but he also articulates a passionate faith in what men can achieve by the grace of the gods , most famously expressed in the conclusion to one of his victory odes : < poem > creatures of a day ! what is anyone ? what is anyone not ? a dream of a shadowis our mortal being . but when there comes to mena gleam of splendour given of heaven , then rests on them a light of gloryand blessed are their days . ( `` pythian 8 '' ) < /poem > his poetry illustrates the beliefs and values of archaic greece at the dawn of the classical period .

blood atonement is a disputed doctrine in the history of mormonism , under which the atonement of jesus alone does not redeem the eternal sin . instead , to atone for this sin , the sinner should be killed in a way that allows his blood to be shed upon the ground as a sacrificial offering , so he does not become a son of perdition . the largest mormon denomination , the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints ( lds church ) , has denied the doctrine since 1889 , with early church leaders referring to it as a `` fiction '' and later church leaders referring to it as a `` theoretical principle '' that had never been implemented in the lds church.the doctrine arose among early mormon leaders and it was significantly promoted during the mormon reformation , when brigham young governed the utah territory as a near-theocracy . sins that young and other members of his first presidency mentioned as meriting blood atonement , since they fall under the category of the eternal sin , included apostasy , theft , fornication ( but not sodomy ) , and adultery.young taught that sinners should voluntarily choose to practice the doctrine , but he also taught that it should only be enforced by a complete theocracy ( which has not existed in modern times ) . young considered it more charitable to sacrifice a life than to see them endure eternal torment in the afterlife . in young 's view , in a full mormon theocracy , the practice would be implemented by the state as a penal measure.the blood atonement doctrine was the impetus behind laws in the territory and state of utah , which allowed capital punishment by firing squad or decapitation . though people in utah were executed by firing squad for capital crimes under the assumption that this would aid their salvation , there is no clear evidence that young or other top theocratic mormon leaders enforced blood atonement for apostasy . there is , however , some evidence that the doctrine was enforced a few times at the local church level without regard to secular judicial procedure . the rhetoric of blood atonement may have contributed to a culture of violence leading to the mountain meadows massacre.blood atonement remains an important doctrine within mormon fundamentalism . within mainstream mormonism , the lds church has informally opined , since 1978 , that the doctrine is no longer in force . lds apostle bruce r. mcconkie , speaking on behalf of church leadership , wrote in 1978 that while he still believed that certain sins are beyond the atoning power of the blood of christ , the doctrine of blood atonement is only applicable in a theocracy , like that during the time of moses . nevertheless , given its long history , up until at least 1994 potential jurors in utah have been questioned on their beliefs concerning the blood atonement prior to trials where the death penalty may be considered .

tumor protein p53 , also known as p53 , cellular tumor antigen p53 ( uniprot name ) , the guardian of the genome , phosphoprotein p53 , tumor suppressor p53 , antigen ny-co-13 , or transformation-related protein 53 ( trp53 ) , is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms , such as `` tp53 '' ( humans ) and `` trp53 '' ( mice ) . this homolog ( originally thought to be , and often spoken of as , a single protein ) is crucial in multicellular vertebrates , where it prevents cancer formation , and thus functions as a tumor suppressor . as such , p53 has been described as `` the guardian of the genome '' because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation . hence `` tp53 '' is classified as a tumor suppressor gene.the name p53 was given in 1979 describing the apparent molecular mass ; sds-page analysis indicates that it is a 53-kilodalton ( kda ) protein . however , the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein ( p53α ) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kda . this difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein , which slow its migration on sds-page , thus making it appear heavier than it actually is . in addition to the full-length protein , the human `` tp53 '' gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms , ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kda . all these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms . the tp53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene ( > 50 % ) in human cancer , indicating that the `` tp53 '' gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation . `` tp53 '' gene encodes proteins that bind to dna and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome .

oxalaia ( in reference to the african deity `` oxalá '' ) is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what is now the northeast region of brazil during the cenomanian stage of the late cretaceous period , sometime between 100.5 and 93.9 million years ago . its only known fossils were found in 1999 on cajual island in the rocks of the alcântara formation , which is known for its abundance of fragmentary , isolated fossil specimens . the remains of `` oxalaia '' were described in 2011 by brazilian palaeontologist alexander kellner and colleagues , who assigned the specimens to a new genus containing one species , oxalaia quilombensis . the species name refers to the brazilian quilombo settlements . `` oxalaia quilombensis '' is the eighth officially named theropod species from brazil and the largest carnivorous dinosaur discovered there . it is closely related to the african genus `` spinosaurus '' , and/or may be a junior synonym of this taxon.although `` oxalaia '' is known only from two partial skull bones , kellner and colleagues found that its teeth and had a few distinct features not seen in other spinosaurids or theropods , including two replacement teeth in each socket and a very sculptured secondary palate . `` oxalaia '' habitat was tropical , heavily forested , and surrounded by an arid landscape . this environment had a large variety of lifeforms also present in middle-cretaceous north africa , due to the connection of south america and africa as parts of the supercontinent gondwana . as a spinosaurid , the traits of `` oxalaia '' skull and dentition indicate a partly piscivorous ( fish-eating ) lifestyle similar to that of modern crocodilians . fossil evidence suggests spinosaurids also preyed on other animals such as small dinosaurs and pterosaurs .

in chemistry , organic compounds are generally any chemical compounds that contain carbon-hydrogen bonds . due to carbon 's ability to catenate ( form chains with other carbon atoms ) , millions of organic compounds are known . the study of the properties , reactions , and syntheses of organic compounds comprises the discipline known as organic chemistry . for historical reasons , a few classes of carbon-containing compounds ( e.g. , carbonate anion salts and cyanide salts ) , along with a handful of other exceptions ( e.g. , carbon dioxide ) , are not classified as organic compounds and are considered inorganic . other than those just named , little consensus exists among chemists on precisely which carbon-containing compounds are excluded , making any rigorous definition of an organic compound elusive.although organic compounds make up only a small percentage of the earth 's crust , they are of central importance because all known life is based on organic compounds . living things incorporate inorganic carbon compounds into organic compounds through a network of processes ( the carbon cycle ) that begins with the conversion of carbon dioxide and a hydrogen source like water into simple sugars and other organic molecules by autotrophic organisms using light ( photosynthesis ) or other sources of energy . most synthetically produced organic compounds are ultimately derived from petrochemicals consisting mainly of hydrocarbons , which are themselves formed from the high pressure and temperature degradation of organic matter underground over geological timescales . this ultimate derivation notwithstanding , organic compounds are no longer defined as compounds originating in living things , as they were historically.in chemical nomenclature , an `` organyl group '' , frequently represented by the letter r , refers to any monovalent substituent whose open valence is on a carbon atom .

analog science fiction and fact is an american science fiction magazine published under various titles since 1930 . originally titled astounding stories of super-science , the first issue was dated january 1930 , published by william clayton , and edited by harry bates . clayton went bankrupt in 1933 and the magazine was sold to street & smith . the new editor was f. orlin tremaine , who soon made `` astounding '' the leading magazine in the nascent pulp science fiction field , publishing well-regarded stories such as jack williamson 's `` legion of space '' and john w. campbell 's `` twilight '' . at the end of 1937 , campbell took over editorial duties under tremaine 's supervision , and the following year tremaine was let go , giving campbell more independence . over the next few years campbell published many stories that became classics in the field , including isaac asimov 's `` foundation '' series , a. e. van vogt 's `` slan '' , and several novels and stories by robert a. heinlein . the period beginning with campbell 's editorship is often referred to as the golden age of science fiction.by 1950 , new competition had appeared from `` galaxy science fiction '' and `` the magazine of fantasy & science fiction . '' campbell 's interest in some pseudo-science topics , such as dianetics ( an early irreligious version of scientology ) , alienated some of his regular writers , and `` astounding '' was no longer regarded as the leader of the field , though it did continue to publish popular and influential stories : hal clement 's novel `` mission of gravity '' appeared in 1953 , and tom godwin 's `` the cold equations '' appeared the following year . in 1960 , campbell changed the title of the magazine to `` analog science fiction & fact '' ; he had long wanted to get rid of the word `` astounding '' in the title , which he felt was too sensational . at about the same time street & smith sold the magazine to condé nast . campbell remained as editor until his death in 1971.ben bova took over from 1972 to 1978 , and the character of the magazine changed noticeably , since bova was willing to publish fiction that included sexual content and profanity . bova published stories such as frederik pohl 's `` the gold at the starbow 's end '' , which was nominated for both a hugo and nebula award , and joe haldeman 's `` hero '' , the first story in the hugo and nebula award–winning `` forever war '' sequence ; pohl had been unable to sell to campbell , and `` hero '' had been rejected by campbell as unsuitable for the magazine . bova won five consecutive hugo awards for his editing of `` analog '' .bova was followed by stanley schmidt , who continued to publish many of the same authors who had been contributing for years ; the result was some criticism of the magazine as stagnant and dull , though schmidt was initially successful in maintaining circulation . the title was sold to davis publications in 1980 , then to dell magazines in 1992 . crosstown publications acquired dell in 1996 and remains the publisher . schmidt continued to edit the magazine until 2012 , when he was replaced by trevor quachri .

ceratosaurs are members of a group of theropod dinosaurs defined as all theropods sharing a more recent common ancestry with `` ceratosaurus '' than with birds . ceratosaurs are believed to have diverged from the rest of theropoda by the early jurassic , however , the oldest confirmed discovered specimens date to the late jurassic . according to the majority of the latest research , ceratosauria includes the late jurassic to late cretaceous theropods `` ceratosaurus '' , `` elaphrosaurus '' , and `` abelisaurus '' , found primarily ( though not exclusively ) in the southern hemisphere . originally , ceratosauria included the above dinosaurs plus the late triassic to early jurassic coelophysoidea and dilophosauridae , implying a much earlier divergence of ceratosaurs from other theropods . however , most recent studies have shown that coelophysoids and dilophosaurids do not form a natural group with other ceratosaurs , and are excluded from this group.ceratosauria derives its names from the type species , `` ceratosaurus nasicornis '' , described by o.c . marsh in 1884 . a moderately large predator from the late jurassic , `` ceratosaurus nasicornis '' , was the first ceratosaur to be discovered . ceratosaurs are generally moderately large in size , with some exceptions like the larger `` carnotaurus '' and the significantly smaller noasaurs . the major defining characteristics of ceratosauria include a robust skull with increased ornamentation or height and a shortening of the arms . both of these characteristics are generally accentuated in later members of the group , such as the abelisaurs , whereas more basal species such as `` c. nasicornis '' appear more similar to other basal theropods . the highly fragmented nature of the ceratosaur fossil record means that the characteristics , relationships , and early history of ceratosauria remain mysterious and highly debated .

anthozoa is a class of marine invertebrates which includes the sea anemones , stony corals and soft corals . adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed , while their larvae can disperse as part of the plankton . the basic unit of the adult is the polyp ; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles . sea anemones are mostly solitary , but the majority of corals are colonial , being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original , founding individual . colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive , plate-like , bushy or leafy forms.anthozoa is included within the phylum cnidaria , which also includes the jellyfish , box jellies and parasitic myxozoa and polypodiozoa . the two main subclasses of anthozoa are the hexacorallia , members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals , sea anemones , tube anemones and zoanthids ; and the octocorallia , which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians ( sea pens , sea fans and sea whips ) , and sea pansies . the smaller subclass , ceriantharia , consists of the tube-dwelling anemones . some additional species are also included as `` incertae sedis '' until their exact taxonomic position can be ascertained.anthozoans are carnivores , catching prey with their tentacles . many species supplement their energy needs by making use of photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues . these species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders . other species lack the zooxanthellae and , having no need for well-lit areas , typically live in deep-water locations.unlike other members of this phylum , anthozoans do not have a medusa stage in their development . instead , they release sperm and eggs into the water . after fertilisation , the planula larvae form part of the plankton . when fully developed , the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate , undergoing metamorphosis into polyps . some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or by breaking in pieces . more than 16,000 species have been described .

capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit . central characteristics of capitalism include private property and the recognition of property rights , capital accumulation , wage labor , voluntary exchange , a price system and competitive markets . in a capitalist market economy , decision-making and investments are determined by every owner of wealth , property or production ability in financial and capital markets whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.economists , political economists , sociologists and historians have adopted different perspectives in their analyses of capitalism and have recognized various forms of it in practice . these include `` laissez-faire '' or free-market capitalism , welfare capitalism , and state capitalism . different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets , public ownership , obstacles to free competition and state-sanctioned social policies . the degree of competition in markets and the role of intervention and regulation as well as the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism . the extent to which different markets are free and the rules defining private property are matters of politics and policy . most of the existing capitalist economies are mixed economies that combine elements of free markets with state intervention and in some cases economic planning.market economies have existed under many forms of government and in many different times , places , and cultures . modern capitalist societies—marked by a universalization of money-based social relations , a consistently large and system-wide class of workers who must work for wages , and a capitalist class which owns the means of production—developed in western europe in a process that led to the industrial revolution . capitalist systems with varying degrees of direct government intervention have since become dominant in the western world and continue to spread . over time , all capitalist countries have experienced consistent economic growth and an increase in the standard of living.critics of capitalism argue that it establishes power in the hands of a minority capitalist class that exists through the exploitation of the majority working class and their labor ; it prioritizes profit over social good , natural resources and the environment ; and it is an engine of inequality , corruption and economic instabilities . supporters argue that it provides better products and innovation through competition , promotes pluralism and decentralization of power , disperses wealth to people who are able to invest in useful enterprises based on market demands , allows for a flexible incentive system where efficiency and sustainability are priorities to protect capital , creates strong economic growth and yields productivity and prosperity that greatly benefit society .

the chesapeake bay bridge–tunnel ( cbbt ) is a bridge–tunnel crossing at the mouth of the chesapeake bay , the hampton roads harbor , and nearby mouths of the james and elizabeth rivers in the u.s. state of virginia . it connects northampton county on the delmarva peninsula and eastern shore with virginia beach , norfolk , chesapeake , and portsmouth on the western shore and south side / tidewater which are part of the hampton roads metropolitan area of eight close cities around the harbor 's shores and peninsula . the bridge–tunnel originally combined of trestle , two 1-mile-long ( 1.6 km ) tunnels , four artificial islands , four high-level bridges , approximately of causeway , and of northeast and southwest approach roads—crossing the chesapeake bay and preserving traffic on the thimble shoals and chesapeake dredged shipping channels leading to the atlantic . it replaced vehicle ferry services that operated from south hampton roads and from the virginia peninsula since the 1930s . financed by toll revenue bonds , the bridge–tunnel was opened on april 15 , 1964 , and remains one of only 11 bridge–tunnel systems in the world , three of which are located in the water dominated hampton roads area of tidewater virginia.as of may 2018 the chesapeake bay bridge–tunnel has been crossed by more than 130 million vehicles . the cbbt complex carries u.s. route 13 ( us 13 ) , the main north–south highway on virginia 's eastern shore on the delmarva peninsula , and , as part of the east coast 's longstanding ocean highway , provides the only straight direct link along the east coast and atlantic ocean , between the eastern shore and south hampton roads regions , as well as an alternate route to link the northeast u.s. and points in between with norfolk and further south to the carolinas , georgia , and florida . the bridge–tunnel saves motorists and hours on a trip between virginia beach/norfolk and points north and east of the chesapeake and delaware valley , river and bay without going through the traffic congestion in the baltimore–washington metropolitan area further west in maryland and northern virginia . from 1995 to 1999 , at an additional cost of almost $ 200 million , the capacity of the above-water portion of bridges on the facility was increased and widened to four lanes . an upgrade of the two-lane tunnels is currently underway.the crossing was officially named the lucius j. kellam jr. bridge–tunnel in august 1987 , 23 years after opening , honoring one of the civic leaders who had long worked for its development , construction and operation ; it continues however to be best known as the chesapeake bay bridge–tunnel . the complex was built by and is operated by the chesapeake bay bridge and tunnel district , a political subdivision of the commonwealth of virginia governed by the chesapeake bay bridge and tunnel commission and in cooperation with the state department of transportation . costs are recovered through toll collections . in 2002 , a joint legislative audit and review commission ( jlarc ) study commissioned by the virginia general assembly concluded that `` given the inability of the state to fund future capital requirements of the cbbt , the district and commission should be retained to operate and maintain the bridge–tunnel as a toll facility in perpetuity . `` occasionally because of similar names , the bridge–tunnel is often confused with the chesapeake bay bridge ( also known as the governor william preston lane , jr. memorial bridge ) further north in maryland crossing the middle portion of the bay from annapolis to kent island on the maryland eastern shore of delmarva . it was built with two lanes and a higher suspension segment in the middle from 1949 - 1952 , with a second parallel wider span of three lanes in 1973 . it is one of the longest and highest bridges in the world .

in fluid dynamics , bernoulli 's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in the fluid 's potential energy . the principle is named after daniel bernoulli who published it in his book `` hydrodynamica '' in 1738 . although bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases , it was leonhard euler who derived bernoulli 's equation in its usual form in 1752 . the principle is only applicable for isentropic flows : when the effects of irreversible processes ( like turbulence ) and non-adiabatic processes ( e.g . heat radiation ) are small and can be neglected.bernoulli 's principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow , resulting in various forms of `` bernoulli 's equation '' ; there are different forms of bernoulli 's equation for different types of flow . the simple form of bernoulli 's equation is valid for incompressible flows ( e.g . most liquid flows and gases moving at low mach number ) . more advanced forms may be applied to compressible flows at higher mach numbers ( see the derivations of the bernoulli equation ) .bernoulli 's principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy . this states that , in a steady flow , the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid along a streamline is the same at all points on that streamline . this requires that the sum of kinetic energy , potential energy and internal energy remains constant . thus an increase in the speed of the fluid – implying an increase in its kinetic energy ( dynamic pressure ) – occurs with a simultaneous decrease in ( the sum of ) its potential energy ( including the static pressure ) and internal energy . if the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir , the sum of all forms of energy is the same on all streamlines because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume ( the sum of pressure and gravitational potential ) is the same everywhere.bernoulli 's principle can also be derived directly from isaac newton 's second law of motion . if a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure , then there is more pressure behind than in front . this gives a net force on the volume , accelerating it along the streamline.fluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight . if a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline , where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure ; and if its speed decreases , it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure . consequently , within a fluid flowing horizontally , the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest , and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest . 
a creole language , or simply creole , is a stable natural language that develops from the simplifying and mixing of different languages into a new one within a fairly brief period of time : often , a pidgin evolved into a full-fledged language . while the concept is similar to that of a mixed or hybrid language , creoles are often characterized by a tendency to systematize their inherited grammar ( e.g. , by eliminating irregularities or regularizing the conjugation of otherwise irregular verbs ) . like any language , creoles are characterized by a consistent system of grammar , possess large stable vocabularies , and are acquired by children as their native language . these three features distinguish a creole language from a pidgin.creolistics , or creology , is the study of creole languages and , as such , is a subfield of linguistics . someone who engages in this study is called a creolist.the precise number of creole languages is not known , particularly as many are poorly attested or documented . about one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500 . these are predominantly based on european languages such as english and french due to the european age of discovery and the atlantic slave trade that arose at that time . with the improvements in ship-building and navigation , traders had to learn to communicate with people around the world , and the quickest way to do this was to develop a pidgin , or simplified language suited to the purpose ; in turn , full creole languages developed from these pidgins . in addition to creoles that have european languages as their base , there are , for example , creoles based on arabic , chinese , and malay . the creole with the largest number of speakers is haitian creole , with almost ten million native speakers , followed by tok pisin with about 4 million , most of whom are second-language speakers.the lexicon ( or , roughly , the base or essential vocabulary – such as `` say '' but not `` said , tell , told '' ) of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages , particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole 's construction . however , there are often clear phonetic and semantic shifts . on the other hand , the grammar that has evolved often has new or unique features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages .

archimedes of syracuse ( ; , `` arkhimḗdēs '' ; ; ) was a greek mathematician , physicist , engineer , inventor , and astronomer . although few details of his life are known , he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity . considered to be the greatest mathematician of ancient history , and one of the greatest of all time , archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems , including : the area of a circle ; the surface area and volume of a sphere ; area of an ellipse ; the area under a parabola ; the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution ; the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution ; and the area of a spiral.other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of pi ; defining and investigating the spiral that now bears his name ; and creating a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers . he was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena , founding hydrostatics and statics , including an explanation of the principle of the lever . he is credited with designing innovative machines , such as his screw pump , compound pulleys , and defensive war machines to protect his native syracuse from invasion.archimedes died during the siege of syracuse , where he was killed by a roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed . cicero describes visiting the tomb of archimedes , which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder , which archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries.unlike his inventions , the mathematical writings of archimedes were little known in antiquity . mathematicians from alexandria read and quoted him , but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until by isidore of miletus in byzantine constantinople , while commentaries on the works of archimedes written by eutocius in the 6th century ad opened them to wider readership for the first time . the relatively few copies of archimedes ' written work that survived through the middle ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the renaissance , while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by archimedes in the archimedes palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results .

the open systems interconnection model ( osi model ) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology . its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols . the model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.a layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it . for example , a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it , while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that constitute the contents of that path.the model is a product of the open systems interconnection project at the international organization for standardization ( iso ) . 
the american revolutionary war ( 17751783 ) , also known as the american war of independence , was initiated by the thirteen original colonies in congress against the kingdom of great britain over their objection to parliament 's direct taxation and its lack of colonial representation . the overthrow of british rule established the united states of america as the first republic in modern history extending over a large territory.early british policy for empire in north america was one of salutary neglect . it largely left the settlers there alone to govern themselves . after 1763 britain gained a new expanded empire , and parliament turned to the navigation acts to increase revenues . that provoked unrest among the thirteen colonies that continued into the next decade . to punish the 1773 boston tea party , parliament 's intolerable acts closed the port of boston and suspended their colonial legislature , as royal governors then did elsewhere . twelve colonial house assemblies sent delegates to the first continental congress . it coordinated a systematic boycott of british goods , then called for a second congress . the second continental congress appointed george washington in june 1775 as its commander in chief to create a continental army and to oversee the siege of boston . their july 1775 olive branch petition was answered by king george iii with a proclamation of rebellion . congress then passed the declaration of independence in july 1776.after evicting the british from boston in 1775 , congress then sponsored an attack on british quebec , but it failed . the british commander in chief , general sir william howe then launched a british counter-offensive , capturing new york city . washington retaliated with harassing attacks at trenton and princeton . howe 's 1777–78 philadelphia campaign captured that city , but the british lost an invading army at saratoga in october 1777 . at valley forge that winter , washington built a professional army . the american victory at saratoga convinced the french to enter into treaties for trade and to defend us independence from britain in 1778.spanish louisiana governor bernardo gálvez routed british forces from spanish territory . this allowed supplies north from the spanish and american privateers for the 1779 virginia militia conquest of western quebec ( later the us northwest territory ) . he then expelled british forces from mobile , alabama and pensacola , cutting off british military assistance to their indian allies in the interior south . howe 's replacement , general sir henry clinton , then mounted a 1778 `` southern strategy '' from charleston . after initial success taking savannah , their losses at king 's mountain and cowpens led to the british southern army retreat to yorktown . a decisive french naval victory brought the october 1781 surrender of the second british army lost in the american revolution.in early 1782 , parliament voted to end all offensive operations in america , and in december 1782 george iii spoke from the british throne for us independence . in april 1783 , congress accepted the british-proposed treaty that met its peace demands including independence and sovereignty west to the mississippi river . on september 3 , 1783 , the treaty of paris was signed between great britain and the united states , recognizing the united states , making peace between the two nations , and formally ending the american revolution .

in norse mythology , the æsir–vanir war was a conflict between two groups of deities that ultimately resulted in the unification of the æsir and the vanir into a single pantheon . the war is an important event in norse mythology , and the implications for the potential historicity surrounding accounts of the war are a matter of scholarly debate and discourse.fragmented information about the war appears in surviving sources , including `` völuspá '' , a poem collected in the `` poetic edda '' in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; in the book `` skáldskaparmál '' in the `` prose edda '' , written in the 13th century by snorri sturluson ; and in euhemerized form in the `` ynglinga saga '' from `` heimskringla '' , also written by snorri sturluson in the 13th century .

the iran–iraq war ( ; “first gulf war” ) began on 22 september 1980 when iraq invaded iran , and it ended on 20 august 1988 , when iran accepted the un-brokered ceasefire . iraq wanted to replace iran as the dominant persian gulf state , and was worried the 1979 iranian revolution would lead iraq 's shia majority to rebel against the ba'athist government . the war also followed a long history of border disputes , and iraq planned to annex the oil-rich khuzestan province and the east bank of the shatt al-arab ( arvand rud ) .although iraq hoped to take advantage of iran 's post-revolutionary chaos , it made limited progress and was quickly repelled ; iran regained virtually all lost territory by june 1982 . for the next five years , iran was on the offensive until iraq took back the initiative in 1988 , and whose major offensives led to the final conclusion of the war . there were a number of proxy forces—most notably the people 's mujahedin of iran siding with iraq and the iraqi kurdish militias of the kdp and puk siding with iran . the united states , britain , the soviet union , france , and most arab countries provided political and logistic support for iraq , while iran was largely isolated.after eight years of war , war-exhaustion , economic devastation , decreased morale , military stalemate , lack of international sympathy against the use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians by iraqi forces , and increased u.s.–iran military tension all led to a ceasefire brokered by the united nations.the conflict has been compared to world war i in terms of the tactics used , including large-scale trench warfare with barbed wire stretched across fortified defensive lines , manned machine gun posts , bayonet charges , iranian human wave attacks , extensive use of chemical weapons by iraq , and , later , deliberate attacks on civilian targets . a special feature of the war can be seen in the iranian cult of the martyr which had been developed in the years before the revolution . the discourses on martyrdom formulated in the iranian shia context led to the tactics of `` human wave attacks '' and thus had a lasting impact on the dynamics of the war.an estimated 500,000 iraqi and iranian soldiers died , in addition to a smaller number of civilians . the end of the war resulted in neither reparations nor border changes .

the mantle ( also known by the latin word pallium meaning mantle , robe or cloak , adjective pallial ) is a significant part of the anatomy of molluscs : it is the dorsal body wall which covers the visceral mass and usually protrudes in the form of flaps well beyond the visceral mass itself.in many species of molluscs the epidermis of the mantle secretes calcium carbonate and conchiolin , and creates a shell . in sea slugs there is a progressive loss of the shell and the mantle becomes the dorsal surface of the animal.the words mantle and pallium both originally meant cloak or cape , see mantle ( vesture ) . this anatomical structure in molluscs often resembles a cloak because in many groups the edges of the mantle , usually referred to as the `` mantle margin '' , extend far beyond the main part of the body , forming flaps , double-layered structures which have been adapted for many different uses , including for example , the siphon .

mount unapproachable is an isolated mountain in the northern territory of australia located in the locality of petermann on the northern side of lake neale in the territory 's southwest . it is about above sea level . the area is remote : the nearest towns are kaltukatjara some away , kintore some away and yulara away . the mountain is mostly made of sandstone.unapproachable was named by the explorer ernest giles in 1872 , whilst on an expedition across central australia . he had just sighted and named lake amadeus , and could see the mountain rising to the west . he hoped to find water at the mountain , but was unable to approach it , as his path was blocked by the lake . giles in fact over-estimated the size of lake amadeus and missed the bridge of land between amadeus and lake neale.in 1889 , giles ' second-in-command , william tietkens , returned on his own expedition to survey the area . in his journal , tietkens wrote that he first travelled to the bloods range , to the south of lakes amadeus and neale . he named the highest peaks mount harris ( for surveyor c. h. harris ) and mount carruthers . from the top of mount harris , he could see kata tjuṯa , the petermann ranges and the tomkinson ranges . tietkens then travelled eastward for three days , and reached lake amadeus . at the western end of the lake and on the north shore , he described a sandstone range , which he named long 's range after his brother-in-law . he climbed a nearby set of hills , and identified mount unapproachable as the westernmost peak of the long 's range . he reported that his team reached unapproachable around the middle of june and then spent several days travelling around the western edge of lake amadeus . he corrected giles ' earlier mistake and successfully mapped the lake 's western shore.another team of surveyors visited the area in 1926 , led by donald mackay and herbert basedow . on 1 july , they climbed a hill that , after comparing his own observations with those of giles and tietkens , basedow identified as both mount unapproachable and mount harris . basedow concluded that this hill was the mount unapproachable that giles had described , and that tietkens had mistakenly renamed it mount harris . on modern maps , however , mount harris and mount carruthers are indeed the names given to two peaks in the bloods range . 
olmec figurines are archetypical figurines produced by the formative period inhabitants of mesoamerica . while not all of these figurines were produced in the olmec heartland , they bear the hallmarks and motifs of olmec culture . while the extent of olmec control over the areas beyond their heartland is not yet known , formative period figurines with olmec motifs were widespread in the centuries from 1000 to 500 bc , showing a consistency of style and subject throughout nearly all of mesoamerica.these figurines are usually found in household refuse , ancient construction fill , and , outside the olmec heartland , graves . however , many olmec-style figurines , particularly those labelled as las bocas- or xochipala-style , were recovered by looters and are therefore without provenance.the vast majority of figurines are simple in design , often nude or with a minimum of clothing , and made of local terracotta . most of these recoveries are mere fragments : a head , arm , torso , or a leg . it is thought , based on wooden busts recovered from the water-logged el manati site , that figurines were also carved from wood , but , if so , none have survived.more durable and better known by the general public are those figurines carved , usually with a degree of skill , from jade , serpentine , greenstone , basalt , and other minerals and stones .

a scripting or script language is a programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks ; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator . scripting languages are often interpreted , rather than compiled.primitives are usually the elementary tasks or api calls , and the language allows them to be combined into more programs . environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications , web pages within a web browser , usage of the shells of operating systems ( os ) , embedded systems , as well as numerous games . a scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment ; in the case of scripting an application , it is also known as an extension language . scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages , as they operate at a high level of abstraction , or as control languages , particularly for job control languages on mainframes.the term `` scripting language '' is also used loosely to refer to dynamic high-level general-purpose languages , such as perl , powershell , python , and tcl with the term `` script '' often used for small programs ( up to a few thousand lines of code ) in such languages , or in domain-specific languages such as the text-processing languages sed and awk . some of these languages were originally developed for use within a particular environment , and later developed into portable domain-specific or general-purpose languages.conversely , many general-purpose languages have dialects that are used as scripting languages . this article discusses scripting languages in the narrow sense of languages for a specific environment.the spectrum of scripting languages ranges from very small and highly domain-specific languages to general-purpose programming languages used for scripting . standard examples of scripting languages for specific environments include : bash , for the unix or unix-like operating systems ; ecmascript ( javascript ) , for web browsers ; and visual basic for applications , for microsoft office applications . lua is a language designed and widely used as an extension language . python is a general-purpose language that is also commonly used as an extension language , while ecmascript is still primarily a scripting language for web browsers , but is also used as a general-purpose language . the emacs lisp dialect of lisp ( for the emacs editor ) and the visual basic for applications dialect of visual basic are examples of scripting language dialects of general-purpose languages . some game systems , notably the second life virtual world and the trainz franchise of railroad simulators have been extensively extended in functionality by scripting extensions ( linden scripting language and trainzscript ) . in other games like wesnoth , the variety of actual games played by players are scripts written by other users . 
sea anemones are a group of marine , predatory animals of the order actiniaria . they are named after the anemone , a terrestrial flowering plant , because of the colourful appearance of many . sea anemones are classified in the phylum cnidaria , class anthozoa , subclass hexacorallia . as cnidarians , sea anemones are related to corals , jellyfish , tube-dwelling anemones , and `` hydra '' . unlike jellyfish , sea anemones do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle.a typical sea anemone is a single polyp attached to a hard surface by its base , but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near the surface of the water . the polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth . the tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey . they are armed with cnidocytes ( stinging cells ) . in many species , additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates , zooxanthellae or with green algae , zoochlorellae , that live within the cells . some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs , small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.sea anemones breed by liberating sperm and eggs through the mouth into the sea . the resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which , after being planktonic for a while , settle on the seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps . sea anemones also breed asexually , by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps . sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums ; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities , as the trade depends on collection from the wild .

gene targeting ( also , replacement strategy based on homologous recombination ) is a genetic technique that uses homologous recombination to modify an endogenous gene . the method can be used to delete a gene , remove exons , add a gene and modify individual base pairs ( introduce point mutations ) . gene targeting can be permanent or conditional . conditions can be a specific time during development / life of the organism or limitation to a specific tissue , for example . gene targeting requires the creation of a specific vector for each gene of interest . however , it can be used for any gene , regardless of transcriptional activity or gene size . 
in music theory , an interval is the difference in pitch between two sounds.an interval may be described as horizontal , linear , or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones , such as two adjacent pitches in a melody , and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones , such as in a chord.in western music , intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale . the smallest of these intervals is a semitone . intervals smaller than a semitone are called microtones . they can be formed using the notes of various kinds of non-diatonic scales . some of the very smallest ones are called commas , and describe small discrepancies , observed in some tuning systems , between enharmonically equivalent notes such as c and d. intervals can be arbitrarily small , and even imperceptible to the human ear.in physical terms , an interval is the ratio between two sonic frequencies . for example , any two notes an octave apart have a frequency ratio of 2:1 . this means that successive increments of pitch by the same interval result in an exponential increase of frequency , even though the human ear perceives this as a linear increase in pitch . for this reason , intervals are often measured in cents , a unit derived from the logarithm of the frequency ratio.in western music theory , the most common naming scheme for intervals describes two properties of the interval : the quality ( perfect , major , minor , augmented , diminished ) and number ( unison , second , third , etc. ) . examples include the minor third or perfect fifth . these names identify not only the difference in semitones between the upper and lower notes , but also how the interval is spelled . the importance of spelling stems from the historical practice of differentiating the frequency ratios of enharmonic intervals such as g–g and g–a .

a counterculture is a culture whose values and norms of behavior differ substantially from those of mainstream society , often in opposition to mainstream cultural mores . a countercultural movement expresses the ethos and aspirations of a specific population during a well-defined era . when oppositional forces reach critical mass , countercultures can trigger dramatic cultural changes . prominent examples of late modern countercultures in the western world include the levellers ( 1645–1650 ) , romanticism ( 1790–1840 ) , bohemianism ( 1850–1910 ) , the non-conformists of the 1930s , the more fragmentary counterculture of the beat generation ( 1944–1964 ) , followed by the globalized counterculture of the 1960s ( 1964–1974 ) , usually associated with the hippie subculture as well as the diversified punk subculture of the 1970s and 1980s .
