provenance , from the french `` provenir '' , `` to come from '' , refers to the history of ownership , or the position of a historical object.the term was originally used in relation to works of art . it is now used in a wide range of fields , including archaeology , paleontology , archives , manuscripts , printed books , and science and computing . the main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery . this has a special value to help authenticate objects , to prove what they are . provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.in archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to `` provenance '' . archaeological researchers use `` provenience '' to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site , whereas `` provenance '' covers an object 's complete documented history . ideally , in modern excavations , the provenience or find spot is recorded ( even videoed ) with great precision , but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known , especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded . an object may have both a provenience ( where it was found ) and a provenance ( where it has been since it was found ) . in some cases , especially where there is an inscription , the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground , as well as its history after rediscovery . 
nuclear fission is a kind of nuclear reaction . it is when an atom splits apart into smaller atoms . some fission reactions give off a lot of energy , and are used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors . nuclear fission was discovered in december 1938 by the german nuclear chemist otto hahn and his assistant fritz strassmann in berlin.an atom is the smallest particle which makes up a chemical element ( e.g . hydrogen , oxygen , magnesium ) . all atoms are very small . atoms are made of three components or particles : protons , neutrons and electrons . the protons and neutrons are clumped together in a ball called a nucleus , at the center of every atom . the electrons orbit around the nucleus in its 'electron cloud ' . elements which have large nuclei , such as uranium and plutonium , can be made to fission.if a ( relatively ) very large atomic nucleus is hit by a slow-moving neutron , it will sometimes become unstable and break into two nuclei . when the nucleus breaks apart ( or fissions ) it releases energy , mostly as gamma rays and heat . it also causes some neutrons to be released from the nucleus.for a few isotopes ( an atom with the same amount of protons but a different amount of neutrons ) such fission can release many neutrons . if those neutrons then hit other atoms , they will make the other atoms split . this can happen again and again . this is called a nuclear chain-reaction , and it can release huge amounts of energy very quickly . the amount of energy released by a nuclear chain reaction is measured in kilotons . one kiloton is the same as the energy of one thousand tons of tnt ( trinitrotoluene ) .in a nuclear bomb , this must happen very quickly to make a very big explosion . in a nuclear reactor this must happen slowly to make heat . the heat is used to boil water into steam , which turns a steam turbine to generate electricity .

liquid scintillation counting is an analytical technique . it is used to measure radiation from beta ( alpha ) - emitting nuclides . it can also detect the auger electrons emitted from chromium-51 ( cr ) and iodine-125 ( i ) samples . samples of nuclides are dissolved or suspended in a `` cocktail '' . the `` cocktail '' is containing an aromatic solvent and small amounts of other additives known as fluors . beta ( alpha ) particles emitted from the sample transfer energy to the solvent molecules . the molecules in turn transfer their energy to the fluors . the excited fluor molecules dissipate the energy by emitting light . scintillation cocktails often contain additives that shift the wavelength of the emitted light . it makes it more easily detected.the samples are placed in small transparent ( often glass or plastic ) vials . they are loaded into a liquid scintillation counter . the counter has two photomultiplier tubes . they are connected in a coincidence circuit . the coincidence circuit assures that genuine light pulses are counted.counting efficiencies under ideal conditions is about 30 % for tritium . tritium is a low-energy beta emitter . it is nearly 100 % for phosphorus-32 ( p ) . phosphorus is a high-energy beta emitter . some chemical compounds and highly colored samples can interfere with the counting process . this interference is known as `` quenching '' . it can be overcome through data correction or through careful sample preparation . p can also be counted in a scintillation counter without the cocktail . this technique is known as cherenkov counting . it relies on the cherenkov radiation being detected directly by the photomultiplier tubes . cherenkov counting in this experimental context is normally used for quick rough measurements .

roman food was mainly obtained from the mediterranean area and gaul ( now france ) . romans enjoyed foodstuffs from the trade networks of the roman republic and empire . keeping up the food supply to the city of rome was a major political issue in the late republic . it became one of the ways the emperor expressed his relationship to the roman people.three meals a day was normal in ancient rome , as today . in the morning , a breakfast called the `` ientaculum '' was served at dawn . later , around 11:00 am , romans ate a small lunch , and in the evening , they ate the `` cena '' , the main meal of the day . in the empire period , the `` cena '' increased in size and diversity . it was now eaten in the afternoon . the `` vesperna '' , a light supper in the evening , was abandoned , and a second breakfast was introduced around noon , the `` prandium '' .in the lower strata of society , the old routine was kept : it corresponded more closely to the daily rhythms of manual labor.originally flat , round loaves made of emmer ( a cereal related to wheat ) with a bit of salt were eaten ; among the upper classes , eggs , cheese , and honey , along with milk and fruit were also consumed . in the empire period , around the beginning of the christian era , bread made of wheat was introduced . later , more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer bread . poor romans ate bread , vegetable , soup and porridge . meat and shellfish were a luxury , unless they lived in the countryside and could go hunting or fishing.the bread was sometimes dipped in wine and eaten with olives , cheese and grapes . they also ate wild boar , beef , sausages , pork , lamb , duck , goose , chickens , small birds and fish . romans liked to make mealtimes fun by roasting hare with wings stuck on them to look like a flying horse.at dinner slaves gave guests small hot bread rolls to wipe their plates clean . roman flour contained a lot of dust and bits and this made bread so coarse that it wore down people 's teeth.the wealthier romans liked to eat snails flattened on milk , peacock 's brains and flamingos tongues .

orbital resonance is a resonance of two orbiting bodies exerting a regular , periodic gravitational effect on each other . their orbital periods may be related by a ratio of two small integers . it is caused by the changing gravitational forces of bodies which go round each other . the stability of the solar system was first investigated by laplace , and there is still much that is not known about it.as a satellite goes round a planet or two stars go round each other , the gravitaional forces can change , sometimes hugely . this is partly because orbits are usually ellipses , not circular , and so the forces change accordingly . also , the planets and stars are usually not spherical . they spin , and vary in their degree of oblateness . this also changes the forces on an orbiting body.in particular , the forces may be unstable , so the smaller partner may change until the forces are stable ( do not change with time ) . satellites often end up with one face towards their planet , because that is the most stable position ( tidal locking ) .there are other stability effects . gaps in saturn 's rings are caused by the particles shifting into more stable positions . in the rings of saturn , the cassini division is a gap between the inner b ring and the outer a ring . it was cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon mimas . jupiter makes similar kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt.there is a stability ratio for neptune and pluto : the 2:3 ratio means pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes neptune to complete three.the area of mechanics which is used for these studies is called celestial mechanics .

kangaroo rats are small rodents from north and central america . they got their name , because they look like small kangaroos , when standing upright . but they are not related to kangaroos , except that they are mammals . the genus of the kangaroo rats is called dipodomys.currently , there are 22 species in that genus . they vary in size from 10cm to 20cm , and weight between 35 and 180 grams for adult animals.kangaroo rats live in dry climates.they can live in deserts also , like thar desert . this means that they have developed traits to other species that live in such climates , but are not related to them . some of those species are the jerboas , which can be found in the deserts of africa and asia , and the hopping mice of the australian outback.all of those species have highly developed hind legs . they also live in deep burrows that protect them from the worst heat of the day . water may be difficult to find in such climates . therefore , they only rarely need to drink water . instead , they have a very efficient metabolism . their kidneys are much more efficient than human kidneys . they can also chemically split off water from the food they eat.kangaroo mice are found in areas of the united states and mexico , where there is some grass or vegetation left , but which have a rather dry climate . scientists call those areas arid and semi-arid . the animals live on seeds , leaves , nuts and other fruit they can find . they also catch insects . they are also known for stockpiling ( keeping ) some food in their burrows , for bad times.usually the animals have a color that blends in nicely with the sandy surroundings . most often they are a tone of dark yellow to deep brown.they are nocturnal which means that they are active during the night .

when computers connect and transmit data between each other on the internet , they follow a set of rules to do so . these rules are universal ; all computers throughout the internet must follow them . otherwise , the internet would not function as computers would not be able to transmit data in a meaningful and useful way . these rules are called protocols . there are many different protocols , each for different purposes , and they all together are called the internet protocol suite . the two most important protocols are the transmission control protocol ( tcp ) and the internet protocol ( ip ) , which ensure data is delivered at the right place , and without errors , and is what computers use when they access servers ( computers that have the data that is accessed on the internet ) on the world wide web , as well as for email , and the like . other protocols include the network time protocol , which ensures clock synchronisation in computers , and there are many others.the tcp/ip model and other related protocols are maintained by the internet engineering task force , whose parent organisation is the internet society , and which also cooperates closely with other standards bodies such as the w3c ( world wide web consortium ) and iso/iec .

taxonomy is a branch of science . it is about the laws and principles of classifying things . from one type of taxonomy , many classifications might be produced.the best-known kind of taxonomy is used for the classification of lifeforms ( living and extinct ) . each organism has a scientific name . this name is part of the biological classification of that species . the name is the same all over the world , so scientists from different places can understand each other . in addition , a species has a position in the tree of life . thus the crow is `` corvus corone '' , a member of the corvidae family , and they are passerine birds . that is well agreed , but the classification of some groups is not agreed at present , and often several classifications are being discussed.living things are classified into three domains : bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes . the highest rank in a domain is the kingdom . each kingdom has many smaller groups in it , called phyla . each phylum has more smaller groups in it , called classes . this pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them . each species is put into a group because of what it does , how and what it eats , special body parts , and so on . at the end of the pattern , the groups ( genera ) are very small . then each species in the genus is given its own name.when someone writes about a living thing and its formal scientific name , they write the genus and species name . this is known as binomial nomenclature , because it uses two names for each organism . the first is the genus name , and the second is the species in that genus . the scientific name of the domestic cat is `` felis catus '' . sometimes it is enough to write `` f. catus '' .these are the major groups ( ranks ) used in taxonomy : kingdom -- > phylum -- > class -- > order -- > family -- > genus -- > speciessome mnemonics ( sayings to help a person remember something ) : when people started naming species , latin was a language widely used in europe . all species names are still written in latin . this has some advantages . since latin is no longer spoken , it is unchanging , and is owned by no-one . it gets over the problem of every language having its own names for animals and plants.scientists used to write the official description of each new species in latin . on 1 january 2012 , the international botanical congress changed to allow english ( as well as latin ) for describing new plant species . the international code of zoological nomenclature recommends choosing a language that is widely used , and that is used in the places where the species lives .

the bassoon is the lowest of the four main instrument of the woodwind family . like the oboe , it has a double reed . the reed is attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a `` crook '' or `` bocal '' which is joined to the main part of the instrument . this consists of two parts called ‘bass joint’ and ‘wing joint’ ( or ‘tenor joint’ ) . these two are joined at the bottom by a u-shaped piece called the ‘boot’ . at the top of the instrument is the ‘bell joint’ . the instrument is quite heavy . some players have a neckstrap around their neck to support the weight , but usually they use a seat strap that connects at the bottom of the boot and goes across the floor . the bassoonist , a person who plays a bassoon , then sits on that strap . the bassoon is held to the right side of the bassoonist and the top of the boot joint is usually level with the players hip . the bassoon , when played right , can sound very beautiful . the bassoon has one of the largest note ranges , going from low b flat to a high f on the top line of the treble clef . the bassoon can also play in tenor clef , but usually plays bass clef.some bassoons have a white , ivory ring round the top of the bell joint . these are german bassoons ( called ‘heckel’ ) . french bassoons ( called ‘buffet’ ) do not have this ring , and also sound quite different to german bassoons . bassoons have keys to help the player to cover all the holes , but these keys do not use the boehm fingering system like the other woodwind instruments . german bassoons use a system called the heckel system , and french bassoons use the buffet system..the bassoon is usually seen as a comical instrument , however it provides a very important role in the orchestra.in fact , the saxophone was invented to replace the bassoon and oboe , however , was rejected because it did n't sound the same in the orchestra .

muon-catalyzed fusion ( μcf ) is a type of cold nuclear fusion , which means that nuclear fusion can happen at low temperatures and under normal pressure . there need to be 3 particles : a muon , a positively charged triton and a positively charged deuteron . the muon , which has a greater mass ( when its not moving ) than an electron , drags the heavier triton and the deuteron to it , creating something called a muonic heavy hydrogen ion . this means that the particle is a hydrogen atom with more protons then electrons , that contains a muon , and that contains extra neutrons which make it heavier . this reaction can be done at room temperature or below , such as -270 degrees celsius.to create these , a stream of negative muons is sent onto blocks of protium , deuterium and tritium ( 3 first isotopes of hydrogen ) . the muon bumps out the electron in the hydrogen atom . because the electron is replaced , any 2 atoms are bound together . this makes a molecular ion , also called a special muonic molecule . a muon is 207 times more massive then an electron . because of the difference in mass , the atom changes . because it is heavier , the atoms in the molecular ion are pressed very tightly together , and then the nuclei , the centers of the atoms , join together . the following process is called nuclear fusion . the 2 nuclei join together and `` glue '' together . but , their weights do not just add up , a part of their mass is released as energy . this is the energy used.now , the process continues because the muon is thrown out of the nuclei when they fuse , so it can join other nuclei , which continues the reaction . sometimes the muon is attached to something else thrown out from the nucleus , and the muon is lost . this stops the reaction.the good thing about this is that muon-catalyzed fusion uses little energy , and produces much energy . the only problem is that the reaction is not stable , so it does not last a long time , because the muons are lost . this process is still a long way from being used for business .

a gyre is a large system of ocean currents moving in a circle . gyres are caused by the coriolis effect . because the earth is rotating , ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to move in a clockwise direction and currents in the southern hemisphere in an anti-clockwise direction . the coriolis force acts most strongly on the wind , and the wind then creates a torque that tends to spin the ocean currents.the earth rotates from the west towards the east , and the coriolis effect becomes more intense toward the poles . because of this , gyres form strong currents on the western side of oceans , so they are pushed against the eastern coast of continents . the vorticity ( the strength of the torque force ) is balanced out by frictional surface currents , which normally act against the spin of the water . however , in the middle of the ocean , the effects of friction are very weak.the term `` gyre '' can be used to mean any type of vortex in the air or the sea , but it is most used in oceanography for the major ocean current systems .

agriculture is an important part of the economy of azerbaijan . it contributes only 6 % of the gdp of the country , but employs 38.3 % of the workforce . 21.78 % of the total land area is arable land ( land where crops can be cultivated ( grown ) ) and 2.1 % are used for permanent crops ( crops which last for many seasons , rather than being replanted after each harvest ) . 16.45 % of the total land area , which makes up the majority of azerbaijan 's cultivated lands , is irrigated . the major crops for are agricultural cash crops , grapes , cotton , tobacco , citrus fruits , rice , tea and vegetables . livestock , dairy products , and wine and spirits are also important farm products . farms in azerbaijan are organized as state and cooperative farms which employ many farmers , and small private farms which are owned and run by one farmer and his/her family . a leading caviar producer and exporter in the past , azerbaijan 's fishing industry today is concentrated on the dwindling supply of sturgeon and beluga in the caspian sea.under the soviet union , agriculture in azerbaijan was collectivized in large state farms . collectivization meant taking the land from owners of all farms and joining it into large farms run by the government . after the collapse of the soviet union , economic reforms took place , which led to the rapid changes in the agricultural sector as well , including privatization . after the `` law on land reforms '' was passed in 1996 , land has been given to individuals who are now allowed to own small private farms and sell their farm products . nevertheless , azerbaijan 's agricultural sector still needs a lot of modernization , if it is to realize its vast potential . prices for agricultural products are below the cost of labor , because the soviet-era communist collective farm system discouraged private initiative ; equipment in general and the irrigation system in particular are old , and modern technology is still not widespread , especially in small private farms .

this is a list of dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from africa.africa has a rich fossil record , but it is patchy and incomplete . prosauropods dating from the late triassic period , about 230 million years ago , have been discovered in madagascar.africa is rich in triassic and lower jurassic dinosaurs . african dinosaurs from these time periods include `` syntarsus '' , `` dracovenator '' , `` melanorosaurus '' , `` massospondylus '' , `` euskelosaurus '' , `` heterodontosaurus '' , `` abrictosaurus '' , and `` lesothosaurus '' . the middle jurassic is poorly represented in africa . only the three sauropods `` cetiosaurus '' , `` lapparentosaurus '' , and `` archaeodontosaurus '' have been discovered dating from this time period.the upper jurassic , however , is well represented in africa , mainly thanks to the spectacular tendaguru formation , a lagerstätte in southeastern tanzania . `` allosaurus '' , `` ceratosaurus '' , `` elaphrosaurus '' , `` giraffatitan '' , `` dicraeosaurus '' , `` janenschia '' , `` tornieria '' , `` tendaguria '' , `` kentrosaurus '' , and `` dryosaurus '' are among the dinosaurs whose remains have been recovered from tendaguru . this fauna seems to show strong similarities to that of the morrison formation in the united states and the lourinha formation in portugal . for example , `` allosaurus '' , `` ceratosaurus '' , and `` dryosaurus '' have been found in both the tendaguru and the morrison . this has important biogeographical implications . this means the animals could travel between most continents at that time ( pangaea ) .the lower cretaceous in africa is known primarily from the northern part of the continent , particularly niger . `` suchomimus '' , `` elrhazosaurus '' , `` spinostropheus '' , `` rebbachisaurus '' , `` nigersaurus '' , `` kryptops '' , `` nqwebasaurus '' , and `` paranthodon '' are some of the early cretaceous dinosaurs known from africa . the early cretaceous was an important time for the dinosaurs of africa because it was when africa finally separated from south america , forming the south atlantic ocean . this was an important event because now the dinosaurs of africa started developing endemism because of isolation.the upper cretaceous of africa is known mainly from north africa . during the early part of the upper cretaceous , north africa was home to a rich dinosaur fauna . it includes `` spinosaurus '' , `` carcharodontosaurus '' , `` rugops '' , `` bahariasaurus '' , `` deltadromeus '' , `` paralititan '' , `` aegyptosaurus '' , and `` ouranosaurus '' . during the latest cretaceous , at the end of the age of dinosaurs , `` majungasaurus '' , `` masiakasaurus '' , `` rapetosaurus '' , and the flying dromaeosaurid `` rahonavis '' lived in africa .

naturism or nudism ( from latin `` nudus '' - `` nude '' ) is a term used by many action groups in society . these action groups usually want to spread the news that being naked is a good feeling , even around other people . usually males and females are mixed and spend their time together . nakedness is seen without any relation to sex . rather , these action groups want to enjoy common activities in the nude , like bathing . often , they also want to do things nude where this is not really necessary , like naked bicycle tours.it is difficult to know exactly when naturism began as an action group . in 1903 , paul zimmermann opened the first club , `` freilichtpark '' ( in english , `` free light park '' ) , near hamburg , germany . in the united states , german immigrant kurt barthel organized the first nudist event in the forest just outside of new york city . his club was called `` the american league for physical culture '' ( alpc ) and started in the late 1920 's . zimmermann 's vice president was a man named ilsley boone . boone had been a minister ( religious leader ) of a large church . he quit to become involved with naturism all the time , and soon replaced zimmermann as president . also , he renamed the alpc as the `` american sunbathing association . '' since 1995 , it is known as the `` american association for nude recreation ( aanr ) . `` naturists come from many different social classes and backgrounds , and practice naturism for very different reasons . in addition , religion can affect how people dress . islam generally does not allow anyone to be seen naked by others , except married couples in private , and young children by their parents and caregivers . traditional judaism is similar , but less strict about a group of people of the same sex . in india , hinduism and jainism have a few rituals with male nudism . buddhism has little to say about naturism . if practiced , it is considered more of a way of living , than anything religious . nudity and naturism are probably the most complicated in christianity . many christians have similar views as those of traditional judaism , the religion from which christianity began and grew out of . others , called `` christian naturists , '' believe it is alright to be nude , and even to live nude , unless it is for the wrong reason or forced . they consider the human body to be the greatest creation of god . they think it is not shameful and should not be covered . in addition , they believe it was the devil , not god , who told adam and eve that they were naked upon eating from a fruit tree which was not theirs .

a flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava.flood basalts have covered areas as large as a continent in prehistory , creating great plateaus and mountain ranges . flood basalts have erupted at various times throughout earth history . they are clear evidence that the earth has periods of higher activity rather than being in a uniform steady state.one explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated melting . then a mantle plume produces vast quantities of a basaltic magma . these have a low viscosity , which is why they 'flood ' rather than form taller volcanoes.flood basalts start at between 100 and 400 km depth , in the asthenosphere . to get a partial melting as large as that of the traps , expelling huge quantities of lava , it is necessary to have a large heat input . such melting can take place near a hotspot , resulting in a mixture of magma from the depths of the hotspot with superficial magma produced by a mantle plume .

antibodies ( also called immunoglobulins ) are large y-shaped proteins that can stick to the surface of bacteria and viruses . they are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates . antibodies are the key element in the adaptive immune system.the antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen . each tip of the `` y '' of an antibody contains a structure ( like a lock ) that fits one particular key-like structure on an antigen . this binds the two structures together.using this binding mechanism , an antibody can `` tag '' a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly . the production of antibodies is the main function of humoral immunity.each antibody is different . they are all designed to attack only one kind of antigen ( in practice , this means virus or bacteria ) . for instance , an antibody designed to destroy smallpox is unable to hit the bubonic plague or the common cold.though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable . this allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist . each of these variants can bind to a different antigen . this enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .

legal tender is fiat money , or currency ( bank notes and coins ) . it has value because a government creates it and backs it , and people using it have faith in its value . fiat money such as us dollars can be used as an exchange for goods and services.the point is that other kinds of money have been used . legal tender differs from commodity money and representative money . commodity money is based on a `` good '' , often a precious metal such as gold or silver , which is desired or has other uses . representative money is a claim on the commodity rather than the actual good . in that case , the gold stays in a bank , and its ownership changes from time to time as the money is used . why might a good be used at all ? one reason is that governments can not just make it . it is said that this stops inflation because , with fiat money , governments can just print more.some economists argue that an economy can only grow if it can produce more capital goods and not more money in the form of credit . this means that good economies must produce things rather than borrow money to buy things produced in other countries.alan greenspan was an early critic of fiat money arguing that `` deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth '' . he thought the value of money should be backed by gold . richard nixon ended gold backing for the united states dollar in 1971 . other countries also changed to fiat currency .

ionization energy is the energy needed to remove the most loosely attached electron from an atom . the atom is not connected to any other atoms . the chemical elements to the left of the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy . the ones to the right have a much higher ionization energy . the chemical elements down the periodic table have a much lower ionization energy ( due to electrons being farther away from the atom with increasing atomic radius ) . the ionization energy increases as each electron is removed.ionization energies are dependent upon the '' atomic radius '' . since going from right to left on the periodic table , the atomic radius increases , and the ionization energy increases from left to right in the periods and up the groups . exceptions to this trend is observed for alkaline earth metals ( group 2 ) and nitrogen group elements ( group 15 ) . typically , group 2 elements have ionization energy greater than group 13 elements and group 15 elements have greater ionization energy than group 16 elements . groups 2 and 15 have completely and half-filled electronic configuration respectively , thus , it requires more energy to remove an electron from completely filled orbitals than incompletely filled orbitals.alkali metals ( ia group ) have small ionization energies , especially when compared to halogens or vii a group . in addition to the radius ( distance between nucleus and the electrons in outermost orbital ) , the number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron ( s ) you 're looking at in the outermost shell have an effect on the ionization energy as well . this effect , where the full positive charge of the nucleus is not felt by outer electrons due to the negative charges of inner electrons partially canceling out the positive charge , is called shielding . the more electrons shielding the outer electron shell from the nucleus , the less energy required to expel an electron from said atom . the higher the `` shielding effect '' the lower the ionization energy . it is because of the shielding effect that the ionization energy decreases from top to bottom within a group . from this trend , cesium is said to have the lowest ionization energy and fluorine is said to have the highest ionization energy ( with the exception of helium and neon ) .

in physics , a phonon is a quantized lattice vibration . the word quantized is used in physics to mean that only certain values of something are allowed . something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs ; you can only move from step to step and you ca n't stand in between steps . something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline ; you can move any distance up or down . a lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal . a crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern . the points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice . solids , liquids , and gases can all experience vibrations . a vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed.intuitively , there is no reason for lattice vibrations to be quantized . the macroscopic or large-scale vibrations of a material are not quantized and can take on essentially any frequency . it is only when we consider the tiny vibrations of the particles that make up a material—atoms and molecules—that the concept of quantization and phonons becomes important . to understand why phonons exist , complicated quantum mechanics is needed . without going into too much detail , the interactions between the constituent atoms or molecules of a crystal are analyzed quantum mechanically . because of their arrangement in a pattern that repeats , when one arrives at a mathematical expression for the frequency of oscillation , one finds that there are only distinct quantized values allowed . there is unfortunately no simple way to explain this .

bit-level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size , depending on very-large-scale integration ( vlsi ) technology . enhancements in computers designs were done by increasing bit-level parallelismincreasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word . ( for example , consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers . the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer , then add the 8 higher-order bits , requiring two instructions to complete a single operation . a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction ) historically , 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit , then 16-bit , then 32-bit microprocessors , then 64-bit microprocessors . 32-bit processors has been a standard in general purpose computing for about 20 years , but now 64-bit processors are taking the lead .

bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells.conjugation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer , as are transformation and transduction , though these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.bacterial conjugation was discovered by nobel prize winners joshua lederberg and edward tatum . they showed that the bacterium `` escherichia coli '' entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information.bacterial conjugation is often incorrectly regarded as the equivalent of sexual reproduction , since it involves the exchange of genetic material . during conjugation the `` donor '' cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon . most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the `` recipient '' cell does not already contain a similar element.the genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient . benefits may include antibiotic resistance , xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites . such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial endosymbionts . other elements , however , may be viewed as bacterial parasites and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread .

a queue is a line of people standing behind one another who are waiting for something . the person at the front of the queue will have his turn next , then the next person and so on . when someone comes to join the queue they have to go to the back of the queue and wait until it is their turn . sometimes people try to `` jump the queue '' or `` push in '' . they are usually told off and have to go to the back of the queue.the word `` queue '' comes from the french word for `` tail '' , but when talking about a queue of people in english it is pronounced `` kyoo '' ( like `` kew '' in `` kew gardens '' ) . the word `` queue '' can be a noun ( `` please stand in the queue '' ) or a verb ( `` please queue over there '' ) .a queue may also be a queue of vehicles waiting to get passed something or to go in somewhere.people may queue to be served in a shop , or queue for a bus or taxi or to go into something like a museum . queueing is much better than pushing one 's way in.sometimes , in places where a lot of people are queueing , there may be a system of numbered tickets . when someone arrives , they take a number and wait until their number is shown on a display board . this system is often used in banks , doctor 's surgeries , passport offices , etc.people waiting in a queue are not always standing around . there may be people who , for example , are waiting to have an operation , but they have to wait `` in a queue '' until one day they receive a letter from the hospital telling them when to come in for their operation.russians often make jokes about queues because , in the days of the soviet union , there was not much in the shops . when a shop had a delivery there would suddenly be a long queue of people . people joined a queue even if they did not know what the queue was for . if they bought something they did not want they could always sell it.perhaps the most famous queue in britain is the queue for promenade tickets ( standing places ) at the bbc proms . people enjoy chatting to one another in the queue . the people who are at the front of the queue can have the first choice of where to stand for the concert . the word queue does not have any word families , however , it has many synonyms . some of these are : chain , line , row , and series . it only has two antonyms , and they are disorder and disorganized .

bernoulli 's principle is an idea of fluid dynamics . it says that as speed of the fluid increases , pressure decreases . the photo on the right shows this happening . the air in the wide part of the tube has a higher static pressure than the thin part . for a steady flow , the amount of fluid entering the pipe must equal the amount leaving the pipe , so the fluid speed in the thin part must increase.when a force acts over an area , it is called `` pressure '' . a higher pressure pushes ( accelerates ) fluid toward lower pressure . so any change in a fluid 's speed must be matched by a change in pressure ( force ) . bernoulli saw that while the fluid moved more quickly in the smaller part of the tube , the pressure became less . please note that this refers to changes in speed and pressure along a single path of flow and does not apply to two different flows at different speeds.the full version of bernoulli 's principle includes both the work by the pressure and by the changes in potential energy from changes in height . in this form , the principle says the total of the pressure , kinetic energy , and potential energy is a constant . ( bernoulli does not consider viscosity or compressibility . )

coral bleaching occurs when stony corals turn white.stony corals are simple animals that form large reefs . the animals live in a endosymbiotic relationship with single-celled algae . to get sunlight the corals live just below sea level . the algae make food products for the coral polyp by photosynthesis.coral polyps are sensitive to changes in their environment . this includes the temperature of the water they live in . under stress , coral polyps may expel the algae which live inside their tissues . the algae provide up to 90 % of the coral 's energy . bleached corals continue to live but begin to starve after bleaching . some corals recover.warmer sea water temperatures caused by global warming is the leading cause of coral bleaching.the united nations environment programme says that the longest recorded global bleaching events happened between 2014 and 2016 . coral was killed on an unprecedented scale . in 2016 , bleaching of coral on the great barrier reef killed between 29 and 50 percent of the reef 's coral.in 2017 , the bleaching got into the central region of the reef . the interval between bleaching events has halved between 1980 and 2016.recent research showed that the coral-algae relationship is much older than was thought . this suggests it has survived many climate changes.some corals change color instead of turning white when they are bleached . the colors can be very bright . in may 2020 , scientists from the university of southampton said that the colors act like sunscreen and protect the coral cells from light . the scientists said this means some corals can lose their algae for a while and might have developed bright colors as a way to make it easier for the algae to come back and to stay alive until then .

proprietary software ( or closed source software ) does not let people see or change source code of the computer software . it is the opposite of free software . proprietary software is usually created by businesses who want to sell their software , but some programs that are free to use are still proprietary because the user is not allowed to change them . with proprietary software , only the people that make the software can see and change the code.even if the people who make the program give the source code to other people , the program will be proprietary if they do not allow to do important things like these : most companies who sell their software for money ( and even some who do not charge money for it ) make it proprietary source . this makes it harder for people to copy and change the software , or to use the source code to make similar software . it helps prevent a user from pretending to be the author of someone else 's work ( a way of plagiarism ) .

qwop is a flash game created by bennett foddy and released on the internet in 2008 to his website called `` foddy.net '' . players play as an athlete named `` qwop '' , who is participating in a 100-meter sprint event at the olympic games . using only the q , w , o and p keys , players must control the movement of the legs to make the character move forward . when the player has successfully reached 50 meters they must jump a hurdle , and at 100 meters the player is encouraged to perform a long jump , although simply passing the finish line is sufficient to complete the game.the game has been criticized for being too hard to get good at . in early december 2010 , the game had a viral popularity outbreak after video blogger ray william johnson reviewed a youtube video that annotates the game , becoming the subject of an internet meme . despite this , the game helped foddy’s site reach 30 million views. < ref name = `` https : //www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain '' > < /ref > after the success of the game , foddy created another flash game called `` girp '' , which was released on his site in 2011. < ref name = `` https : //www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/no-pain-no-gain '' > < /ref >
