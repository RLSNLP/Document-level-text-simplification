methods of computing square roots are numerical analysis algorithms for finding the principal ( non-negative ) root of a real number which when multiplied by itself yields s ; algebraically , it means a procedure for finding the non-negative root of the equation x - s = 0 ; geometrically , it means given the area of a square , a procedure for constructing a side of the square.every real number has two square roots . the principal square root of most numbers is an irrational number with an infinite decimal expansion . as a result , the decimal expansion of any such square root can only be computed to some finite-precision approximation . however , even if we are taking the square root of a perfect square integer , so that the result does have an exact finite representation , the procedure used to compute it may only return a series of increasingly accurate approximations.the continued fraction representation of a real number can be used instead of its decimal or binary expansion . this representation has the property that the square root of any rational number ( which is not already a perfect square ) has a periodic , repeating expansion , similar to how rational numbers have repeating expansions in the decimal notation system.the most common analytical methods are iterative and consist of two steps : finding a suitable starting value , followed by iterative refinement until some termination criteria is met . the starting value can be any number , but fewer iterations will be required the closer it is to the final result . the most familiar such method , most suited for programmatic calculation , is newton 's method , which is based on a property of the derivative in the calculus . a few methods like paper-and-pencil synthetic division and series expansion , do not require a starting value . in some applications , an integer square root is required , which is the square root rounded or truncated to the nearest integer ( a modified procedure may be employed in this case ) .the method employed depends on what the result is to be used for , how much effort is willing to put into the procedure , and what tools are at hand . the methods may be roughly classified as those suitable for mental calculation , those which are implemented as programs to be executed on a digital electronic computer or other computing device . algorithms may take into account convergence ( how many iterations are required to achieve a specified precision ) , computational complexity of individual operations , and error propagation ( the accuracy of the final result ) .procedures for finding square roots ( particularly the square root of 2 ) have been known since at least the period of ancient egypt was the first ascertainable algorithm for computing square root . modern analytic methods began to be developed after introduction of the arabic numeral system to western europe in the early renaissance . today , nearly all computing devices have a fast and accurate square root function , either as a programming language constructions , a compiler intrinsic or library function , or a hardware operator , based on one of the described procedures .

 in economics , inflation is the price of goods as they go up , and there is a drop in the purchasing power in an economy . when inflation goes too high , people buy fewer goods and services . this is called deflation.the opposite of inflation is deflation . deflation is when there is a decrease in the price level of goods and services . the common measure of inflation is the inflation rate , the annualized percentage change in a general price index , usually the consumer price index , over time.some people believe that very high rates of inflation and hyperinflation are caused by a high growth of the money supply . many people think that low or moderate inflation may be due to fluctuations in real demand for goods and services , or changes in available supplies , such as during scarcities . however , the consensus view is that a long-lasting period of inflation is caused by money supply growing faster than the rate of economic growth.inflation affects economies in many positive and negative ways . negative effects include an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money , uncertainty over future inflation which may discourage investment and savings , and if inflation were rapid enough , prices will begin hoarding out of concern that prices will increase in the future . positive effects include reducing unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity , allowing the central bank more leeway in carrying out monetary policy , encouraging loans and investment instead of money hoarding .

protein folding is the physical process by which a protein chain folds its native 3-dimensional structure , a conformation that is usually biologically functional . it is the physical process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional three-dimensional structure from a random coil . each protein exists as an unfolded polypeptide or random coil when translated from a sequence of mrna to a linear chain of amino acids . this polypeptide lacks any stable ( long-lasting ) three-dimensional structure ( the left hand side of the first figure ) . as the polypeptide chain is being synthesized by a ribosome , the linear chain begins to fold into its three-dimensional structure . folding begins to occur even when translation of the polypeptide chain . amino acids interact with each other to produce a well-defined three-dimensional structure , the folded protein ( the right hand side of the figure ) . the resulting three-dimensional structure is determined by the amino acid sequence or primary structure ( anfinsen 's dogma ) .the correct three-dimensional structure is essential to function . some parts of functional proteins may remain unfolded , so protein dynamics is important . failure to fold into native structure generally produces inactive proteins , but in some instances misfolded proteins have modified or toxic functionality . several neurodegenerative and other diseases are believed to result from the accumulation of amyloid fibrils formed by misfolded proteins . many allergies are caused by incorrect folding of some proteins , because the immune system does not produce antibodies for certain protein structures.protein folding of proteins is a process of transition from the folded to the unfolded state . it happens in cooking , in burns , in proteinopathies , and in other contexts.the duration of the folding process varies dramatically depending on the protein of interest . when studied outside the cell , the slowest folding proteins require many minutes or hours to fold primarily due to proline isomerization , and must pass through a number of intermediate states , like checkpoints , before the process is complete . on the other hand , very small single-domain proteins with lengths of up to a hundred amino acids typically fold in a single step . time scales of milliseconds are the norm and the very fastest known protein folding reactions are complete within a few microseconds .

sir john everett millais , 1st baronet ( 8 june 1829 – 13 august 1896 ) was an english painter and illustrator . he was one of the founders of the pre-raphaelite brotherhood . he was a child prodigy who , when he was eleven , was the youngest student to enter the royal academy schools . the pre-raphaelite brotherhood was founded at his family home in london , at 83 gower street ( now number 7 ) . millais became the most famous exponent of the style , his painting `` christ in the house of his parents '' ( 1849-50 ) created a huge controversy , and he produced a picture that could serve as the embodiment of the historical and naturalist focus of the group , `` ophelia '' , in 1851–52.by the mid-1850s , millais was moving away from the pre-raphaelite style to develop a new form of realism in his art . his later works were enormously successful , making millais one of the richest artists of his day , but some former admirers including william morris saw this as a sell-out ( millais notoriously allowed one of his paintings to be used for a sentimental soap advertisement ) .while these and early 20th-century critics , reading art through the lens of modernism , viewed much of his later production as wanting , this perspective has changed in recent decades , as his later works have come to be seen in the context of wider changes and advanced tendencies in the broader late 19-century art world , and can now be seen as predictive of the art world of the present.millais ' personal life has also played a significant role in his reputation . his wife effie was formerly married to the critic john ruskin , who had supported millais ' early work . the annulment of the marriage and her wedding to millais have sometimes been linked to his change of style , and they became a powerful promoter of his work , and they worked in concert to secure commissions and expand their social and intellectual circles .

a digital signal is a signal that represents data as a series of values ; at any time it can only take on , at most , one of a finite number of values . this contrasts with an analog signal , which represents continuous values ; at any given time it represents a real number within a continuous range of values.simple digital signals represent information in discrete bands of analog levels . all levels within a band of values represent the same information state . in most digital circuits , the signal can have two possible valid values ; this is called a binary signal or logic signal . they are represented by two voltage bands : one near a reference value ( typically termed as `` ground '' or zero volts ) , and the other near the supply voltage . these correspond to the two values `` zero '' and `` one '' ( or `` false '' and `` true '' ) of the boolean domain , so at any given time a binary signal represents one binary digit ( bit ) .because of this discretization , relatively small changes to the analog signal levels do not leave the discrete envelope . as a result , they are ignored by signal state sensing circuitry . as a result , digital signals have noise immunity ; electronic noise , provided it is not too great , will not affect digital circuits .

direct memory access ( dma ) is a technology used in computers . it allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory ( random-access memory ) independent of the central processing unit ( cpu ) .without dma , when the cpu is using programmed input/output , it can not perform other work . with dma , the cpu first initiates the transfer , then it does other operations while the transfer is in progress , and it finally receives an interrupt from the dma controller ( dmac ) when the operation is done . this feature is useful at any time that the cpu can not keep up with the rate of data transfer , or when the cpu needs to perform work while waiting for a slow i/o data transfer . many hardware systems use dma , including disk drive controllers , graphics cards , network cards and sound cards . dma is also used for intra-chip data transfer in multi-core processors . computers that have dma channels can transfer data to and from devices with much less cpu overhead than computers without dma channels . similarly , a processing element inside a multi-core processor can transfer data to and from its local memory without occupying its processor time , allowing computation and data transfer to occur in parallel.dma can also be used for `` memory to memory '' copying or moving of data within memory . dma can offload expensive memory operations , such as large copies or scatter-gather operations , from the cpu to a dedicated dma engine . an example is the i/o acceleration technology . dma is of interest in network-on-chip and in-memory computing architectures .

psilocybin is a psychedelic drug . it is made by psilocin . psilocybin is a substance found naturally in mushrooms . there are more than 200 species of psilocybin mushrooms . the most potent are members of the genus `` psilocybin '' , such as `` psilocybin azurescens '' , `` p. semilanceata '' , and `` p. cyanescens '' . however , psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera.in general , the effects include euphoria , visual and mental hallucinations , changes in perception , a distorted sense of time , and spiritual experiences . it can also include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.imagery found on prehistoric murals and rock paintings of modern-day spain and algeria suggests that human use of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history . in mesoamerica , the mushrooms had long been consumed in spiritual ceremonies before spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century . in 1959 , the swiss chemist albert hofmann isolated the active principle psilocybin from the mushroom `` psilocybe mexicana '' . hofmann 's employer sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide . the increasingly restrictive drug laws of the late 1960s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens . the popularity of psilocybin and other hallucinogens grew in the next decade.the intensity and duration of the effects of psilocybin are variable , depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms , dosage , individual physiology , and set and setting , as as was shown in experiments led by timothy leary at harvard university in the early 1960s . once ingested , psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin , which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain . the mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours , although the effects may last much longer , since the drug can distort the perception of time . possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries , and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws .

ostracoderms ( greek : ὄστρακον+δέρμα `` shell-skinned '' ) are the armored jawless fish of the palaeozoic era . the term does not often appear in classifications today because it is paraphyletic or polyphyletic , and thus does not correspond to one evolutionary lineage . however , the term is still used as an informal way of loosely grouping together the armored jawless fishes.the first fossil fishes that were discovered were ostracoderms . the swiss anatomist louis agassiz received some fossils of bony armored fish from scotland in the 1830s . he had a hard time classifying them as they did not resemble any living creature . he compared them at first with living armored fish such as catfish and sturgeons but later realizing that they had no movable jaws , classified them in 1844 into a new group `` ostracoderms '' which means `` shell-skinned ''.ostracoderms have heads covered with a bony shield . they are among the earliest creatures with bony heads . the microscopic layers of that shield appear to evolutionary biologists , `` like they are composed of little tooth-like structures . '' neil shubin writes : `` cut the bone of the [ ostracoderm ] skull open…you find virtually the same structure as in our teeth . there is a layer of enamel and even a layer of pulp . the whole shield is made up of thousands of small teeth fused together . this bony skull , one of the earliest in the fossil record , is made entirely of little teeth . this bony skull originally arose to bite creatures ( see conodonts ) ; later a version of teeth was used in a new way to protect them.ostracoderms existed in two major groups , the more primitive heterostracans and the cephalaspids . the cephalaspids were more advanced than the heterostracans in that they had lateral stabilizers for more control of their swimming.it was long thought that pteraspidomorphs and thelodonts were the only ostracoderms with paired nostrils , while the other groups have just a single median nostril . but it has since been revealed that even if galeaspidans have just one external opening , it has two internal nasal organs.after the appearance of jawed fish ( placoderms , acanthodians , sharks , etc . ) about 420 million years ago , most ostracoderm species went extinct at the end of the devonian period . more recent research indicates , however , that fish with jaws had far less to do with the extinction of the ostracoderms than previously assumed , as they coexisted without noticeable decline for about 30 million years.the subclass ostracodermi has been placed in the division agnatha along with the extant subclass cyclostomata , which includes lampreys and hagfishes .

 the battle of verdun was one of the most important battles of world war i . it was fought from 21 february 1916 to 18 december 1916 . the battle was the longest of the first world war . the battle took place on the hills north of verdun-sur-meuse . the german 5th army attacked the defences of the fortified region of verdun , and those of the french second army on the east bank of the meuse.the germans planned to capture the meuse heights , an excellent defensive position with good observation for artillery-fire on verdun . the germans hoped that the french would commit their strategic reserve to recapture the position , and suffer catastrophic losses at little cost to the germans.poor weather delayed the beginning of the attack until 21 february . the germans captured fort douaumont in the first three days . by 6 march , french divisions were in the rfv and a more extensive defence in depth had been constructed . philippe pétain ordered no retreat and that german attacks were to be counter-attacked , despite this exposing french infantry to german artillery-fire.by 29 march , french guns on the west bank had begun a constant bombardment of germans on the east bank , causing many infantry casualties . the german attack was extended to the left ( west ) bank of the meuse , to gain observation and eliminate the french artillery firing over the river but the attacks failed to reach their objectives.in early may , the germans changed tactics again and made local attacks and counter-attacks ; the french recaptured part of fort douaumont but then the germans left them and took many prisoners . the germans tried alternating their attacks on either side of the meuse and in june captured fort vaux . the germans advanced towards the last geographical objectives of the original plan , at fleury-devant-douaumont and fort souville , driving a salient into the french defences . fleury was captured and the germans came within of the verdun citadel but in july the offensive was cut back to provide troops , artillery and ammunition for the battle of the somme , leading to a similar transfer of the french tenth army to the somme front . from 23 june to 17 august , fleury changed hands sixteen times and a german attack on fort souville failed . the offensive was reduced further but to keep french troops in the rfv , away from the somme , ruses were used to disguise the change . in september and december , french counter-offensives recaptured much ground on the east bank and recovered fort douaumont and fort vaux.the battle lasted for the longest and one of the most costly in human history . in 2000 , hannes heer and klaus naumann calculated that the french suffered and the germans a total of an average of a month . in france , the battle came to symbolise the determination of the french army and the destructiveness of the war .

the sino-soviet split was the breaking of political relations between the people 's republic of china ( prc ) and the union of soviet socialist republics ( ussr ) . it was caused by their different interpretations of marxism-leninism . their influence during the cold war ( 1945–1991 ) was very large . in the late 1950s and early 1960s , sino-soviet debates about the interpretation of orthodox marxism became specific disputes about the ussr 's policies of national de-stalinization and international peaceful coexistence with the western world . against that ideological background , china opposed the ussr 's policy of peaceful coexistence between the eastern bloc and the western bloc . in 1961 , nikita khrushchev denounced stalinism in the speech `` on the cult of personality and its consequences '' ( 25 february 1956 ) . sino-soviet split was a question of who would lead the revolution for world communism , and to whom the vanguard parties of the world would turn for political advice , financial aid , and military assistance : to china or to the soviet union ? in that vein , the prc and the prc competed for the leadership of world communism through the vanguard parties native to the countries in their spheres of influence.in the western world , the sino-soviet split made the bi-polar cold war into a tri-polar cold war , a geopolitical event as important as the erection of the berlin wall ( 1961 ) , the defusing of the cuban missile crisis ( 1962 ) , and the end of the vietnam war ( 1955–1975 ) , because the rivalry facilitated mao 's realisation of sino-american rapprochement with the 1972 nixon visit to china . moreover , the occurrence of the sino-soviet split voided the concept of monolithic communism , the western perception that the communist nations were collectively a unitary actor in post-second world war geopolitics , especially during the 1947–1950 period in the vietnam war , when the us intervened to the first indochina war ( 1946–1954 ) . historically , the sino-soviet split facilitated the marxist-leninist `` realpolitik '' of the late-period cold war ( 1956–1991 ) as well as the quad-polar geopolitics ( prc-uk-usa-ussr ) until the suez crisis of 1956 .

in quantum field theory , the casimir effect and casimir–polder force are physical forces arising from a quantized field . they are named after the dutch physicist hendrik casimir , who predicted them in 1948 . the casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and dielectrics alters the vacuum value of the second-quantized electromagnetic field . since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics , the casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.any medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the casimir effect . for example , beads on a string as well as plates submerged in turbulent water or gas illustrate the casimir force.in modern theoretical physics , the casimir effect plays an important role in the chiral bag model of the nucleon ; in applied physics it is important in some aspects of emerging microtechnologies and nanotechnologies .

in physical sciences , mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy . it is the macroscopic energy associated with a system . the principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces , then its mechanical energy is constant . if an object moves in the opposite direction of a conservative net force , the potential energy will increase ; and if the speed ( not the velocity ) of the object changes , the kinetic energy of the object also changes.in all real systems , however , nonconservative forces , such as frictional forces , will be present , but if they are small , the mechanical energy changes little and its conservation is a useful approximation .

the mathematical concept of a hilbert space , named after david hilbert , generalizes the notion of euclidean space . it extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions . a hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured . furthermore , hilbert spaces are complete : there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.hilbert spaces arise naturally in mathematics and physics , typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces . the earliest hilbert spaces were studied from this point of view in the first decade of the 20th century by david hilbert , erhard schmidt , and frigyes riesz . they are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations , quantum mechanics , fourier analysis ( which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer ) , and ergodic theory ( which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics ) . john von neumann coined the term `` hilbert space '' for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications . the success of hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis . apart from the classical euclidean spaces , examples of hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions , spaces of sequences , sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions , and hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.geometric intuition plays an important role in many aspects of hilbert space theory . exact analogs of the pythagorean theorem and parallelogram law hold in a hilbert space . at a deeper level , perpendicular projection onto a subspace ( the analog of `` dropping the altitude '' of a triangle ) plays a significant role in optimization problems and other aspects of the theory . an element of a hilbert space can be uniquely specified by its coordinates with respect to a set of coordinate axes ( an orthonormal basis ) , in analogy with cartesian coordinates in the plane . when that set of axes is countably infinite , the hilbert space can also be usefully thought in terms of the space of infinite sequences that are square-summable . the latter space is often in the older literature referred to as `` the '' hilbert space . linear operators on a hilbert space are likewise concrete objects : in good cases , they are simply transformations that stretch the space by different factors in mutually perpendicular directions in a sense that is made precise by the study of their spectrum .

the use of toxic chemicals as weapons dates back thousands of years , but the first large scale use of chemical weapons was during world war i . they were mainly used to demoralize , injure , and kill entrenched defenders , against the indiscriminate and generally very slow-moving or static nature of gas clouds would be most effective.the types of weapons used included disabling chemicals , such as tear gas , to lethal agents like phosgene , chlorine , and mustard gas . this chemical warfare was a major component of the first global war and first total war of the 20th century . the killing capacity of gas was limited , with about ninety thousand casualties from a total of 1.3 million casualties caused by gas attacks . gas was unlike most other weapons of the period because it was possible to develop countermeasures , such as gas masks . in the later stages of the war , as the use of gas increased , its overall effectiveness declined . the widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare , and wartime advances in the composition of high explosives , gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of world war i as `` the chemist 's war '' and also the era where weapons of mass destruction were created.the use of poison gas by all major belligerents throughout world war i constituted war crimes as its use violated the 1899 hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the 1907 hague convention on land warfare prohibited the use of `` poison or poisoned weapons '' in warfare . there was a great amount of horror and public controversy at the use of chemical weapons and its consequences led to far less use of chemical weapons by combatants during world war ii .

in the days of sailing ships , a vessel would carry several ship 's boats for various uses . one would be a longboat , an open boat to be rowed by eight or ten oarsmen , two per thwart . the longboat was double banked ; its rowing benches were designed to accommodate two men each pulling an oar on opposite sides . other boats sometimes embarked on a sailing ship included the cutter , whaleboat , gig , jolly boat , launch , dinghy , and punt.unlike the dinghy or the cutter , the longboat would have fairly fine lines aft to permit its use in steep waves such as surf or wind against tide where need be . like other ships ' boats , the longboat could be rigged for sailing but was primarily a pulling boat . it had the double-banked arrangement in common with the cutter . this was possible as it had a beam similar to a cutter 's but broader than that of a gig which was single banked.the longboat was generally more seaworthy than the cutter , which had a fuller stern for carrying cargo as well as laying out an anchor and cable . in a seaway or surf therefore , the cutter was more prone to broaching . `` the oxford english dictionary '' notes uses of the word from 1515 to 1867 . in later years , particularly in the royal navy , the longboat tended to be replaced by the whaler . the cutter was still in use in the 1950s but had been largely replaced by the motor cutters.in some places such as tristan da cunha and pitcairn island , the surfboats are known as longboats . this is probably because the settlers who introduced them were european seamen . the tristan da cunha boats are single banked . what is believed to be the only remaining example of a traditionally built tristan da cunha longboat , `` carlisle '' , named after the royal navy ship of the same name which made visits to the island in 1932 and 1937 , is located in the national maritime museum cornwall.the french link is to chaloupe , which in this context is a cutter , but lent its name to the dutch `` sloep '' or sloop .

hammurabi ( ) was the sixth king of mesopotamia , ruling from about 1792 bc to about 1750 bc . he was preceded by his father , sin-muballit , who abdicated due to bad health . during his reign , he conquered elam and the city-states of larsa , eshnunna , and mari . he forced his son mut-ashkur to pay tribute , bringing almost all of mesopotamia under babylonian rule.hammurabi is best known for having issued the code of hammurabi , which he claimed to have received from shamash , the babylonian god of justice . unlike earlier sumerian law codes , such as the code of ur-nammu , which focused on compensating the victim of the crime , the law of hammurabi was one of the first law codes to place greater emphasis on the physical punishment of the perpetrator . it prescribed specific penalties for each crime and is among the first codes to establish the presumption of innocence . although its penalties are extremely harsh by modern standards , they were intended to limit what a wronged person was permitted to do in retribution . the code of hammurabi and the law of moses in the torah contain numerous similarities.hammurabi was seen by many as a god within his own lifetime . after his death , hammurabi was revered as a great conqueror who spread civilization and forced all peoples to pay obe cogent to marduk , the national god of the babylonians . later , his military accomplishments became de-emphasized and his role as the ideal lawgiver became the primary aspect of his legacy . for later mesopotamians , hammurabi 's rule became the frame of reference for all events occurring in the distant past . even after the empire he built collapsed , he was still revered as a model ruler , and many kings across the near east claimed him as an ancestor . hammurabi was rediscovered by archaeologists in the late 19th century and has since been seen as an important figure in the history of law .

cruelty to animals , also called animal abuse , animal neglect or animal cruelty , is when a person hurts animals to cause suffering or harm . more narrowly , it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievement , such as killing animals for entertainment . cruelty to animals sometimes includes inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself , defined as zoosadism.people have tried to make laws about animal cruelty in many places around the world . some laws govern methods of killing animals for food , clothing , or other products , and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment , education , research , or pets . there are a number of possible approaches to the issue of cruelty to animals to animals.some think that the animal welfare position holds that there is nothing inherently wrong with using animals for human purposes , such as food , clothing , entertainment , fun and research . it should be done in a way that minimizes unnecessary pain and suffering , sometimes called `` humane '' treatment . others have argued that the definition of 'unnecessary ' varies widely and could include almost all current use of animals.critics argue from the position of costs and benefits and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals . some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach which is closer to the animal welfare position , whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights . animal rights theorists criticize these positions , arguing that the words `` unnecessary '' and `` humane '' are subject to widely different interpretations , and that animals have basic rights . they say that most animal use itself is unnecessary and a cause of suffering , so the only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never used as a substance or as a non-living thing .

the chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star . the current value of the chandrasekhar limit is about ( ) .white dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure ( compare main sequence stars , which resist collapse through thermal pressure ) . the chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star 's core is insufficient to balance the star 's own gravitational self-attraction . consequently , a white dwarf with a mass greater than the limit is subject to further gravitational collapse , evolving into a different type of stellar remnant , such as a neutron star or black hole . those with masses up to the limit remain stable as white dwarfs.the limit was named after subrahmanyan chandrasekhar . chandrasekhar improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930 by calculating the limit for a polytrope model of a star in hydrostatic equilibrium , and comparing his limit to the earlier limit found by e. c. stoner for a uniform density star . the existence of a limit , based on the conceptual breakthrough of combining relativity with fermi degeneracy , was indeed first established in separate papers published by wilhelm anderson and e. c. stoner in 1929 . the limit was initially ignored by scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes , which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time . the fact that the roles of stoner and anderson are often overlooked in the astronomy community has been noted .

snakes are long , legless , carnivorous reptiles of the suborder serpentes.like all other squamates , snakes are ectothermic , amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales . many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors , which makes them swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws . to accommodate their narrow bodies , snakes ' paired organs ( such as kidneys ) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side , and most have only one lung . some species still retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently . this led to many lineages of legless lizards . legless lizards resemble snakes , but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears , which snakes lack.living snakes are found on every continent except antarctica , and on most smaller land masses ; exceptions include some large islands , such as ireland , iceland , greenland , the hawaiian archipelago , and the islands of new zealand , and many small islands of the atlantic and central pacific oceans . additionally , sea snakes are widespread throughout the indian and pacific oceans .

a cargo cult is a millenarian belief system in which people practice rituals which they believe will cause a more advanced society to deliver goods . these cults were first described in melanesia in the wake of contact with western military forces during the second world war.cargo cults often develop when a large number of people start to have problems . the leader may have a `` vision '' ( or `` myth-dream '' ) of the future . they may have an ancestral efficacy ( `` mana '' ) thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality . this leader may characterize the present state as a dismantling of the old social order , meaning that social hierarchy and ego boundaries have been broken down.contact with colonizing groups brought about considerable change in the way indigenous peoples of melanesia have thought about other societies . early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that those practitioners simply failed to understand technology , colonization , or capitalist reform . in this model , cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the systems involved in resource distribution . they attempt to get such goods in the wake of interrupted trade . however , many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new `` social '' relationships , with material relations being secondary.since the late twentieth century , alternative theories have arisen . for example , some scholars , such as kaplan and lindstrom , focus on europeans ' characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about western commodity fetishism . others point to the need to see each movement as reflecting a particular historical context .
a g-type main-sequence star ( spectral type : g-v ) is a main-sequence star ( luminosity class v ) of spectral type g. such a star has about 0.84 to 1.15 solar masses and surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 k. like other main-sequence stars , a g-type main-sequence star is converting the element hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion . the sun , the star to which the earth is gravitationally bound in the solar system , is an example of a g-type main-sequence star ( g2v type ) . each second , the sun fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium in a process known as the proton-proton chain , converting about 4 million tons of matter to energy . besides the sun , other well-known examples of g-type main-sequence stars include alpha centauri a , tau ceti , and 51 pegasi.the term `` yellow dwarf '' is a misnomer , because g-type stars actually range in color from white , for more luminous types like the sun , to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous g-type main-sequence stars.the sun is in fact white , and its spectrum peaks in blue and green light . but it can often appear yellow , orange or red through earth 's atmosphere due to atmospheric rayleigh scattering , especially at sunrise and sunset . in addition , although the term `` dwarf '' is used to contrast yellow main-sequence stars from giant stars , yellow dwarfs like the sun outshine 90 % of the stars in the milky way ( which are largely dimmer orange dwarfs , red dwarfs , and white dwarfs ) .a g-type main-sequence star will fuse hydrogen for about 10 billion years , until it is exhausted at the center of the star . when this happens , the star expands to many times its previous size and becomes a red giant , such as aldebaran ( or alpha tauri ) . eventually the red giant sheds its outer layers of gas , which become a planetary nebula , while the core cools and contracts into a compact , dense white dwarf .

an oil spill is the release of liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment , especially the marine ecosystem . the term is usually given to marine oil spills , where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters , but spills may also occur on land . oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers , offshore platforms , drilling rigs and wells , as well as spills of refined petroleum products ( such as gasoline , diesel ) and their by-products , heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel , or any oily refuse or waste oil.oil spills penetrate into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals . this makes an oil spill more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water . cleanup and recovery from an oil spill depends on many factors , including the type of oil spilled , the temperature of the water ( affecting evaporation and biodegradation ) , and the types of shorelines and beaches involved . spills may take weeks , months or even years to clean up.oil spills can have disastrous consequences for society ; economically , environmentally , and socially . as a result , oil spill accidents have initiated intense media attention and political uproar , bringing many together in a political struggle concerning government response to oil spills and what actions can best prevent them from happening .
in five-dimensional geometry , a demipenteract or 5-demicube is a semiregular 5-polytope , made from a `` 5-hypercube '' ( penteract ) with alternated vertices removed.it was discovered by thorold gosset . since it was the only semiregular 5-polytope ( made of more than one type of regular facets ) , he called it a 5-ic semi-regular.it exists in the k polytope family as 1 with the gosset polytopes : 2 , 3 , and 4.the graph formed by the vertices and edges of the demipenteract is sometimes called the clebsch graph , though that name sometimes refers to the folded cube graph of order five instead .

 equivalent weight ( or gram equivalent ) is the mass of one substance , that is the mass of a given substance which can combine with or displace a fixed quantity of another substance . the equivalent weight of an element is the mass which combines or displaces 1.008 gram of hydrogen , or 8.0 grams of oxygen , or 35.5 grams of chlorine . these values correspond to the atomic weight divided by the usual valence ; for oxygen as example that is 16.0g / 2.in acid-base reactions , the equivalent weight of an acid or base is the mass which supplies or reacts with one mole of hydrogen cations ( ) . for redox reactions , the equivalent weight of each reactant supplies or reacts with one mole of electrons ( e ) in a redox reaction.equivalent weight has the dimensions and units of mass , unlike atomic weight , which is dimensionless . equivalent weights were originally determined by experiment , but are now derived from molar masses . additionally , the equivalent weight of a compound can be calculated by dividing the molecular mass by the number of positive or negative electrical charges that result from the dissolution of the compound .

in cryptography , key size or key length is the number of bits in a key used by a cryptographic algorithm ( such as a cipher ) .key length defines the upper-bound on an algorithm 's security ( i.e . a logarithmic measure of the fastest known attack against an algorithm ) , since the security of all algorithms can be violated by brute-force attacks . ideally , the lower-bound on an algorithm 's security is by design equal to the key length ( that is , the security is determined entirely by the key length , or in other words , the algorithm 's design does n't detract from the degree of security inherent in the key length ) . indeed , most symmetric-key algorithms are designed to have security equal to their key length . however , after design , a new attack might be discovered . for example , triple des was designed to have a 168 bit key , but an attack of complexity 2 is now known ( i.e . triple des now only has 112 bits of security , and of the 168 bits in the key the attack has rendered 56 'ineffective ' towards security ) . nevertheless , as long as the security ( understood as 'the amount of effort it would take to gain access ' ) is sufficient for a particular application , then it does n't matter if key length and security coincide . this is important for asymmetric-key algorithms , because no such algorithm is known to satisfy this property ; elliptic curve cryptography is the best with an effective security of roughly half its key length .

 the 2008 atlantic hurricane season was an event that occurs when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin . the season officially started on june 1 and ended on november 30 . these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the atlantic basin . however , the formation of tropical storm arthur caused the season to start one day early . this was the only year on record in which a major hurricane existed in every month from july through november in the north atlantic . bertha was the longest-lived july tropical cyclone on record for the basin , the first of several long-lived systems during 2008.the season was damaging for haiti , where nearly 800 people were killed by four consecutive tropical cyclones ( fay , gustav , hanna , and ike ) , especially hurricane hanna , in august and september . these four storms caused about $ 1 billion in damage in haiti alone . the precursor to kyle and the outer rain bands of paloma also impacted haiti . cuba also received heavy impacts from gustav , ike , and paloma , with gustav and ike making landfall in the country at major hurricane intensity and paloma being a category 2 when striking the nation . more than $ 10 billion in damage and 8 deaths occurred there.ike was the most destructive storm of the season , as well as the strongest in terms of minimum barometric pressure , devastating cuba as a major hurricane and later making landfall near galveston , texas as a large high-end category 2 hurricane . one very unusual feat was a streak of tropical cyclones affecting land , with all but one system impacting land in 2008 . the unusual number of storms with impact led to one of the deadliest and destructive seasons in the history of the atlantic hurricane basin , especially with ike , as its overall damages made it the second-costliest hurricane in the atlantic at the time , although it would later drop to sixth after hurricanes sandy , harvey , irma , and maria .

jean léopold nicolas frédéric , baron cuvier , frs ( 23 august 1769 – 13 may 1832 ) , known as georges cuvier , was a french naturalist and zoologist.cuvier was a major figure in natural sciences research in the early 19th century , and was important in establishing the fields of comparative anatomy and paleontology through his work in comparing living animals with fossils . he is also known for his ideas about the supposed scientific differences between races and for his abuse of sarah baartman as part of this 'work'.cuvier 's work is considered the foundation of vertebrate paleontology , and he expanded linnaean taxonomy by grouping classes into phyla and incorporating both fossils and living species into the classification . cuvier is also known for establishing extinction as a fact—at the time , extinction was thought by many of cuvier 's contemporaries to be merely controversial speculation . in his `` essay on the theory of the earth '' ( 1813 ) cuvier proposed that now-extinct species had been wiped out by periodic catastrophic flooding events . in this way , cuvier became the most influential supporter of catastrophism in geology in the early 19th century . he studied the strata of the paris basin with alexandre brongniart established the basic principles of biostratigraphy.among his other accomplishments , cuvier proposed that elephant-like bones found in usa belonged to an extinct animal he later would name as a mastodon , and that a large skeleton dug up in paraguay was of `` megatherium '' , a giant , prehistoric ground sloth . he named the pterosaur `` pterodactylus '' , the aquatic reptile `` mosasaurus '' , and was one of the first people to suggest the earth had been dominated by reptiles , rather than mammals , in prehistoric times.cuvier is also remembered for strongly opposing theories of evolution , which at the time ( before darwin 's theory ) were mainly proposed by jean-baptiste de lamarck and geoffroy saint-hilaire . cuvier believed there was no evidence for evolution , but found evidence for cyclical creations and destructions of life forms by global extinction events such as deluges.in 1830 , cuvier and geoffroy had a famous debate , which is said to exemplify the two major deviations in biological thinking at the time – whether animal structure was due to function or ( evolutionary ) morphology . cuvier supported function and rejected lamarck 's thinking.cuvier also conducted racial studies which provided part of the foundation for scientific racism . he examined work on the supposed differences between racial groups ' physical properties and mental abilities . cuvier conducted an autopsy after her death , and conducted an autopsy following her death , comparing her physical features to those of monkeys.cuvier 's most famous work is `` le règne animal '' ( 1817 ; english : `` the animal kingdom '' ) . in 1819 , he was created a peer for life in honor of his scientific contributions . thereafter , he was known as baron cuvier . he died in paris during an epidemic of cholera . some of cuvier 's most influential followers were louis agassiz on the continent and in the united states , and richard owen in britain . his name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the eiffel tower .

in computer architecture , 64-bit integers , memory addresses , or other data units are those that are 64 bits ( 8 octets ) wide . also , 64-bit cpu and alu architectures are those that are based on registers , address buses , or data buses of that size . 64-bit microcomputers are computers in which 64-bit microprocessors are the norm . from the software perspective , 64-bit computing means the use of code with 64-bit virtual memory addresses . however , not all 64-bit instruction sets support full 64-bit virtual memory addresses ; x86-64 and armv8 , for example , support only 48 bits of virtual address , with the remaining 16 bits of the virtual address required to be all 0 's or all 1 's , and several 64-bit instruction sets support fewer than 64 bits of physical memory address.in 2003 , 64-bit cpus were introduced to the ( formerly 32-bit ) mainstream personal computer market in the form of x86-64 processors and the powerpc g5 , and were introduced in 2012 into the arm architecture targeting smartphones and tablet computers , first sold on september 20 , 2013 , in the iphone 5s powered by the armv8-a apple a7 system on a chip ( soc ) .a 64-bit register can hold any of 2 ( over 18 quintillion or 1.8×10 ) different values . the range of integer values that can be stored in 64 depends on the integer representation used . with the two most common representations , the range is 0 through 18,446,744,073,709,551 ( 2 − 1 ) for representation as an ( unsigned ) binary number , and −9,223,372,036,854,775,807 ( −2 ) for representation as two 's complement . so , a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 2 bytes ( =16 exabytes ) of byte-addressable memory .

a simile is a figure of speech that compares two things . similes are different from metaphors because they use words like `` like '' , `` as '' or `` than '' , while metaphors create an implicit comparison . this is shown in the etymology of the words : simile comes from the latin word `` simile '' ( `` similar , like '' ) , and metaphor comes from the greek word `` metaphor in '' ( `` to transfer '' ) . while similes are mainly used in forms of poetry that compare the inanimate and living , there are also terms in which similes are used for humorous purposes and comparison .
fusion power is a hypothetical ( theoretical or imagined ) form of nuclear fusion . it is the idea that two atoms combine to make a heavier nucleus ( that is the nucleus of stars ) . fusion is done by combining these atoms , and releasing energy , which is then released as heat and light . it is hoped that this fusion will produce much more power than the electrical input , which would normally be destroyed by nuclear fission.fusion reactors generally use hydrogen isotopes such as deuterium and tritium , which react more easily than hydrogen to allow them to reach the lawson criterion requirements with less extreme conditions . most designs aim to heat their fuel to tens of millions of degrees , which produces a major challenge in producing a successful design . however , nuclear fusion has some advantages over fission . these include reduced radioactivity in operation , little high-level nuclear waste , ample fuel supplies , and increased safety . however , the necessary combination of temperature , pressure , and duration has proven to be difficult to produce in a practical and economical manner . research into fusion reactors began in the 1940s , but to date , no design has produced more fusion power output than the electrical power input , defeating the purpose . a second issue that affects common reactions is managing neutrons that are released during the reaction , which over time degrade many common materials used within the reaction chamber.fusion researchers have investigated various confinement concepts . the early focus was on three main systems : z-pinch , stellarator , and magnetic mirror . the current leading designs are the tokamak and inertial confinement ( icf ) by laser . both designs are under research at very large scales , most notably the iterative tokamak in france , and the national ignition laser in the united states . researchers are also studying other designs that may offer cheaper approaches . among these alternatives , there is increasing interest in magnetized target fusion and inertial electrostatic confinement .

overcharge is an economic term . it is the difference between the observed market price and a price that would have been observed . the former is often called a `` but-for price '' or a `` benchmark price '' . when collusion is not in use , such as by privately owned businesses , overcharge is a markup of the observed market price for the sole profit of the business.an overcharge is often expressed as a mark-up on the benchmark price , or it may be divided by the observed market price . when the benchmark price is equal to the marginal cost of production , as it is in perfect competition , then ratio of the overcharge to market price is the lerner index of market power.the word is also used ( as verb and noun ) to describe cases where more than an agreed or standard price is charged for goods or services in a transaction , such as a lawyer bills for more hours than actually worked , a restaurant bill includes items not ordered or is added incorrectly , a builder charges an unreasonable amount for repair work , and so on . overcharging in this sense may be a criminal offence ( charging for work not done ) , in others not ( a high charge when a price was not agreed ) .

 was the name for a number of deities in ancient mesopotamia . they were deities with extraordinary powers and were often envisioned as being of tremendous physical size . the deities typically wore `` melam '' , an ambiguous substance which `` covered them in terrifying splendor '' . they could also be worn by heroes , kings , giants , and even demons.the effect that seeing a deity 's `` melam '' has on a human is described as `` ni '' , a word for the `` physical tingling of the flesh '' . both the sumerian and akkadian languages contain many words to express the sensation of `` ni '' , including the word `` puluhtu '' , meaning `` fear '' . deities were almost always depicted wearing horned caps , consisting of up to seven superimposed pairs of ox-horns . they were also sometimes depicted wearing clothes with elaborate decorative gold and silver ornaments sewn into them.the ancient mesopotamians believed that their deities lived in heaven , but that a god 's statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself . as such , cult statues were given constant care and attention and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them . these priests would clothe the statues and place feasts before them so they could `` eat '' . a deity 's temple was believed to be that deity 's literal place of residence . the gods had boats , full-sized barges which were normally stored inside their temples and were used to transport their cult statues along waterways during various religious festivals . the gods also had chariots , which were used for transporting their cult statues by land . sometimes a deity 's cult statue would be transported to the location of a battle so that the deity could watch the battle unfold . the major deities of the mesopotamian pantheon were believed to participate in the `` assembly of the gods '' , through which the gods made all of their decisions . this assembly was seen as a divine counterpart to the semi-democratic legislative system that existed during the third dynasty of ur ( 2112 bc – 2004 bc ) .the mesopotamian pantheon evolved greatly over the course of its history . in the first phase , starting in the fourth millennium bc , deities were mainly focused on basic needs for human survival . during the second phase , the divine hierarchy became more structured and deified kings began to enter the pantheon . during the third phase , in the second millennium bc , the gods worshipped by an individual person and gods associated with the commoners became more prevalent . during the fourth and final phase , in the first millennium bc , the gods became closely associated with specific human empires and rulers . the names of over 3,000 mesopotamian deities have been recovered from cuneiform texts . many of these are from lengthy lists of deities compiled by ancient mesopotamian scribes . the longest of these lists is a text entitled `` an = antum '' , a babylonian scholarly work listing the names of over 2,000 sumerian deities with their semitic equivalents and their semitic equivalents.the anunnaki are a group of deities first attested during the reign of gudea ( 2144 bc – 2124 bc ) and the third dynasty of ur . originally , the anunnaki appear to have been heavenly deities with immense powers , who were believed to `` decree the fates of mankind '' . later they became regarded as chthonic underworld deities . they are chiefly mentioned in literary texts and very little evidence to show that any cult of them has yet been unearthed . this is likely due to the fact that each member of the anunnaki had his or her own individual cult , separate from the others . similarly , no representations of the anunnaki as a group have been identified . another group of deities are the igigi , who are first attested from old babylonian scribes ( 1830 bc – 1531 bc ) . the name igigi is a word for `` physical tingling of the flesh '' .

in is a computer operating system that makes it possible to replace pages using paging . paging is used to decide which memory pages to page out , sometimes called swap out , or write to disk , when a page of memory needs to be allocated . page replacement happens when a requested page is not in memory ( page fault ) and a free page can not be used to satisfy the allocation , either because there are none , or because the number of free pages is lower than some threshold.when the page that was selected for replacement and paged out is referenced again it has to be paged in ( read in from disk ) , this involves waiting for i/o completion . this determines the `` quality '' of the the page replacement algorithm : the less time waiting for page-ins , the better the algorithm . a page replacement algorithm looks at the limited information about accesses to the pages provided by hardware , and tries to guess which pages should be replaced to minimize the total number of page misses , while balancing this with the costs ( primary storage and processor time ) of the algorithm itself.the page replacing problem is a typical online problem from the competitive analysis perspective in the sense that the best deterministic algorithm is known .

in continuum mechanics , stress is the measure of the force that neighbouring particles of a continuous material exert on each other . strain is the measure of the deformation of the material . for example , when a solid vertical bar is supporting an overhead weight , each particle in the bar pushes on the particles immediately below it . when a liquid is in a closed container under pressure , each particle gets pushed against all the surrounding particles . stress is the result of a very large number of intermolecular forces and collisions between the particles in those molecules.strain inside a material may arise by various mechanisms , such as forces to the bulk material ( like gravity ) or to its surface ( like contact forces , external pressure , or friction ) . any strain ( deformation ) of a solid material generates an internal `` elastic stress '' , like a spring , which tends to restore the material to its original non-deformed state . in liquids and gases , only deformations that change the volume generate persistent elastic stress . however , if the deformation changes gradually with time , even in fluids there will usually be some `` viscous stress '' , opposing that change . elastic and viscous stresses are usually combined under the name `` mechanical stress '' .
a brief history of time : from the big bang to black holes is a book on cosmology by english physicist stephen hawking . it was first published in 1988 . hawking wrote the book for readers without knowledge of the universe , and people who are just interested in learning something new.in `` a brief history of time '' , hawking writes in non-technical terms about the structure , origin , development and eventual fate of the universe . he talks about basic concepts like space and time , basic building blocks that make up the universe ( such as quarks ) and the fundamental forces that govern it ( such as gravity ) . he writes about cosmological phenomena such as the big bang and black holes . he discusses two major theories , general relativity and quantum mechanics , that modern scientists use to describe the universe . finally , he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the universe in a coherent manner.the book became a bestseller and sold more than 25 million copies .

enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts . they accelerate chemical reactions . all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at fast enough to live . metabolic pathways depend on enzymes to catalyze individual steps.enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types . other biocatalysts are catalytic rna molecules , called ribozymes . enzymes ' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.like all catalysts , enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy . some enzymes make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster . an extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase , which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds . chemically , enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions . enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific . enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules . inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity , and activators are molecules that increase enzyme activity . many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors .

 the history of alphabetic writing goes back to the consonantal writing system used for semitic languages in the levant in the 2nd millennium bc . most or nearly all alphabetic scripts used throughout the world today ultimately go back to this semitic proto-alphabet.the first origins can be traced back to a proto-sinaitic script developed in ancient egypt to represent the language of semitic-speaking workers and slaves in egypt . unskilled in the complex hieroglyphic system used to write the egyptian language , it required a large number of pictograms . they selected a small number of those commonly seen in their egyptian surroundings to describe the sounds , as opposed to the semantic values of their own canaanite language . this script was partly influenced by the older egyptian hieratic , a cursive related to egyptian hieroglyphs.mainly through phoenician , hebrew and aramaic , the semitic alphabet became the ancestor of many writing systems across the middle east , europe , northern africa and south asia.some modern authors distinguish between consonantal scripts of the semitic type , called `` abjads '' since 1996 , and `` true alphabets '' in the narrow sense , the distinguishing criterion being that true alphabets consistently assign letters to both consonants and vowels on the same basis , while the symbols in a pure abjad stand only for consonants . ( so-called impure abjads may use diacritics or a few symbols to represent vowels . ) in this sense , the first true alphabet would be the greek alphabet , which was adapted from the phoenician alphabet . however , not all scholars and linguists think this is enough to strip away the original meaning of an alphabet to one with both vowels and consonants . latin , the most widely used alphabet today , comes from the etruscan and greek alphabets , themselves from phoenician .

stoichiometry is a way of calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.stoichiometry is founded on the law of conservation of mass where the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products . this results in the ratio of reactants and products . this means that if the amounts of the separate reactants are known , then the amount of the product can be calculated . however , if one reactant has a known quantity and the quantity of the products can be empirically determined , then the amount of the other reactants can also be calculated.this is illustrated in the image below , where the balanced equation is : here , one molecule of methane reacts with two molecules of oxygen gas to yield one molecule of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water.stoichiometry measures these quantitative relationships , and is used to determine the amount of products and reactants that are produced or needed in a given reaction . describing the quantitative relationships among substances as they participate in chemical reactions is known as reaction stoichiometry . in the example above , reaction stoichiometry measures the relationship between the quantities of methane and oxygen that react to form carbon dioxide and water.because of the well known relationship of moles to atomic weights , the ratios that are arrived at by stoichiometry can be used to determine quantities by weight in a reaction described by a balanced equation . this is called `` composition stoichiometry '' . `` gas stoichiometry '' deals with reactions involving gases , where the gases are at a known temperature , pressure , and volume and can be assumed to be ideal gases . for gases , the volume ratio is ideally the same by the ideal gas law , but the mass ratio of a single reaction has to be calculated from the molecular masses of the reactants and products . in practice , due to the existence of isotopes , molar masses are used instead when calculating the mass ratio .

semeval ( semantic evaluation ) is a series of evaluations of computational semantic analysis systems ; it evolved from the senseval word sense evaluation series . the evaluations are intended to explore the nature of meaning in language . while meaning is intuitive to humans , transferring those meanings to computational analysis has proved elusive.this series of evaluations is providing a mechanism to characterize in more precise terms exactly what is necessary to compute in meaning . as such , the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning . these exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions that are involved in our use of language . they began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally . they have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence ( e.g. , semantic role labeling ) , relations between sentences ( e.g. , coreference ) , and the nature of what we are saying ( semantic relations and sentiment analysis ) .the purpose of the semeval and senseval exercises is to evaluate semantic analysis systems . `` semantic analysis '' refers to a formal analysis of meaning , and `` computational '' refer to approaches that in principle support effective implementation.the first three evaluations , senseval-1 and senseval-3 , were focused on word sense disambiguation , each time growing in the number of languages offered in the tasks and in the number of participating teams .

a dynasty is a group of rulers from the same family . the word is most commonly used to describe kings and queens who have ruled for more than a hundred years . dynasties are usually used to mean someone who has ruled for a long time from the time when the last male monarch was in power , or someone who ruled for a long time from the time when the last male monarch died , according to the law . dynasties can also mean someone who has ruled for a long time from when they were first ruled . for example , queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom was a member of a dynasty from the time of her father 's death until her mother 's death when she was 92 years old . but this is not a complete picture of the history of the world as a whole , and it is not a very good description.historians use the word `` dynasty '' to mean the history of many different countries and civilizations , such as ancient egypt ( 3100-30 ) and imperial china ( 221-30 ) , using a framework of successive dynasties . as such , the term `` dynasty '' may be used to delimit the era during which a family ruled . it can also be used to describe events , trends and artifacts of that period ( e.g. , `` a ming-dynasty vase '' ) . until the 19th century , it was taken for granted that a legitimate function of a monarch was to increase the wealth and power of his family members.prior to the 20th century , dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been pronounced patrilineally , such as under the frankish salic law . in nations where it was permitted , succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband 's ruling house . this has changed in some places in europe , where succession law and convention have maintained dynasties `` de jure '' through a female . for example , the house of windsor will be maintained through the children of queen elizabeth ii , as it did with the house of orange-nassau through three successive queens regnant .

 grapevines is a genus of 79 species of flowering plants in the flowering plant family vitaceae . the genus is made up of species mainly from the northern hemisphere . it is economically important as the source of grapes , both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine . the study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.most `` vitis '' varieties are wind-pollinated with hermaphroditic flowers containing both male and female reproductive structures . these flowers are grouped in bunches called inflorescences . in many species , such as `` vitis vinifera '' , each successfully pollinated flower becomes a grape berry with the inflorescence turning into a cluster of grapes . the flowers of the grapevines are usually very small , the berries are often large and brightly colored with sweet flavors that attract birds and other animals to disperse the seeds contained within the berries.rapevines usually produce fruit on shoots that came from buds that were developed during the previous growing season . in viticulture , this is one of the principles behind pruning the previous year 's growth ( or `` one year old wood '' ) that includes shoots that have turned hard and woody during the winter ( after harvest in commercial viticulture ) . these vines will be pruned either into a cane which will support 8 to 15 buds or to a smaller spur which holds 2 to 3 buds .
in thermodynamics , the internal energy of a system is the energy that can be stored as heat or light within the system . it is the energy necessary to create or prepare the system in any given state , but does not include the kinetic energy of motion of the system as a whole , nor the potential energy of the system as a whole due to external force fields which includes the energy of displacement of the system 's surroundings.the internal energy of a system can be increased by introduction of matter or by heat , or reduced when thermodynamic work is done by the system . when matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls , the system is said to be closed and the first law of thermodynamics defines the change in internal energy as the difference between the energy added to the system as heat and the thermodynamic work done by the system on its surroundings . if the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy , the system is said to be isolated and its internal energy can not change.the internal energy of a given state of a system can not be directly measured , and knowledge of all components is rarely interesting . thermodynamics is concerned only with `` changes '' in the internal energy , not with its absolute value .

anaerobic respiration is respiration using oxygen ( o ) as the energy for respiration . oxygen is not the final electron acceptor , so the process still uses a respiratory electron transport chain.in aerobic organisms undergoing respiration , electrons are shuttled to an electron transport chain , and the final electron acceptor is oxygen . in anaerobes , other less-oxidizing substances such as nitrate ( no ) , fumarate , sulphate ( so ) , or sulphur ( s ) are used . these terminal electron acceptors have smaller reduction potentials than o , meaning that less energy is released per oxidized molecule . this makes anaerobic respiration less efficient than aerobic .
diffusion is the movement of anything ( for example , atom , ions , molecules ) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.diffusion is needed in many fields , including physics , chemistry , biology , sociology , economics and finance.an object ( for example , atom , idea , etc . ) spreads out from a place or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.a gradient is the change in the value of a quantity , for example , concentration , pressure , or temperature with the change in another variable , usually distance . a change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient , a change in pressure over a distance is called a pressure gradient , and a change in temperature over a distance is called a temperature gradient.the word diffusion derives from the latin word , `` diffundere '' , which means `` to spread out .

habitants were french settlers and the inhabitants of french origin who farmed the land along the two shores of the st. lawrence river and gulf in what is the present-day province of quebec in canada . the term was used by the inhabitants themselves and the other classes of french canadian society from the 17th century up to the early 20th century when the usage of the word declined in favour of the more modern `` agriculteur '' ( farmer ) or `` producteur agricole '' ( agricultural producer ) .habitants in new france were largely defined by a condition on the land , stating that it could be forfeited unless it was cleared within a certain period of time . this condition kept the land from being sold by the seigneur , leading instead to its being sub-granted to peasant farmers , the habitants . when an habitant was granted the title deed to a lot , he had to agree to accept a variety of annual charges and restrictions . rent was the most important of these and could be set in money , produce or labour . once this rent was set , it could not be altered , neither due to inflation or time . a habitant was essentially free to develop his land as he wished , with only a few obligations to his seigneur.likewise , a seigneur did not have many responsibilities towards his habitants . the seigneur was obligated to build a gristmill for his tenants , and they , in turn , were required to grind their grain there and provide the seigneur with one sack of flour out of every 14 . the seigneur also had the right to a specific number of days of forced labor by the habitants and could claim rights over fishing , timber and common pastures.the demands of the seigneurs became more significant at the end of french rule , they could never obtain enough resources from the habitants to become truly wealthy , nor leave their tenants in poverty . habitants were free individuals ; seigneurs simply owned a `` bundle of specific and limited rights over productive activity within that territory '' . the seigneur–habitant relationship was one where both parties were owners of the land who split the attributes of ownership between them .

in computing , booting is the process of starting a computer . it is started by hardware such as a button press , or by a software command . after it is switched on , a computer 's central processing unit ( cpu ) has no software in its main memory , so some process must load software into memory before it can be executed . this may be done by hardware or firmware in the cpu , or by a separate processor in the computer system.restarting a computer also is called rebooting , which can be `` hard '' , e.g. , after electrical power to the cpu is switched from off to on , or `` soft '' , where the power is not cut . on some systems , a soft boot may optionally clear ram to zero . both hard and soft booting can be initiated by hardware such as a button press or by software command . booting is done by the operating system running the operating system and some applications on it.the process of returning a computer from a state of hibernation or sleep does not involve booting . minimally , some embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to begin functioning and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in rom . all computing systems are state machines , and a reboot may be the only method to return to a designated zero-state from an unintended , locked state.in addition to loading an operating system or stand-alone utility , the boot process can also load a storage dump program for diagnosing problems in an operating system . `` boot '' is short for `` bootstrap '' or `` bootstrap load '' and derives from the phrase `` to pull oneself up by one 's bootstraps '' . the usage calls attention to the requirement that , if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer , some mechanism must exist to load the initial software onto the computer before this problem . early computers used a variety of ad-hoc methods to get a small program into memory to solve this problem . the invention of read-only memory ( rom ) of various types solved this paradox by allowing computers to be shipped with a start up program that could not be erased .

in mathematics , a projection is a mapping of a set ( or other mathematical structure ) into a subset ( or sub-structure ) , which is equal to its square . the restriction to a subspace of a projection is also called a `` projection '' , even if the idempotence property is lost.an everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane ( paper sheet ) . the projection of a point is its shadow on the paper sheet . the shadow of a point on the paper sheet is this point itself . the shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a closed disk.originally , the notion of projection was introduced in euclidean geometry to denote the projection of the euclidean space of three dimensions onto a plane in it , like the shadow example . the two main projections of this kind are : the concept of projection in mathematics is a very old one , most likely has its roots in the phenomenon of the shadows cast by real-world objects on the ground . this rudimentary idea was refined and abstracted , first in a geometric context and later in other branches of mathematics . over time different versions of the concept developed , but today , in a sufficiently abstract setting , we can unify these variations.in cartography , a map projection is a map of a part of the surface of the earth onto a plane , which , in some cases , is the restriction of a projection in the above meaning . the 3d projections are also at the basis of the theory of perspective .

the narrows is the tidal strait separating the boroughs of staten island and brooklyn in new york city , united states . it connects the upper new york bay and lower new york bay and forms the principal channel by which the hudson river empties into the atlantic ocean.the narrows was most likely formed after deposition of the harbor hill moraine about 18,000 years prior to the end of the last ice age . previously , staten island and brooklyn were connected and the hudson river emptied into the ocean through the present course of the raritan river , by taking a more westerly course through parts of present-day northern new jersey , along the eastern side of the watchung mountains to bound brook , new jersey , and then on into the atlantic ocean via raritan bay . a build-up of water in the upper bay allowed the river to break through to form the narrows less than 12,000 to 13,000 years ago.the first recorded european entrance into the narrows was in 1524 by giovanni da verrazzano , who set anchor in the strait and was greeted by a group of lenape , who paddled out to meet him in the strait.in august 1776 , the british forces under william howe on staten island performed an amphibious operation across the narrows and landed in brooklyn , where they defeated washington 's army at the battle of long island . in 1964 the narrows was spanned by the verrazzano-narrows bridge , the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time , and still the longest suspension bridge in the united states ( by length of the main span ) .

mather tower ( later lincoln tower , as designated on the michigan-wacker historic district roster ; now identified primarily by its address ) is a neo-gothic , terra cotta-clad high-rise structure in chicago , illinois , united states.it is located at 75 east wacker drive in the downtown `` loop '' area , adjacent to the chicago river.the -high building is sometimes called `` the inverted spyglass '' by chicagoans due to its highly unusual design , an 18-story octagonal tower atop a more conventional 24-story rectangular `` box . '' briefly the tallest building in chicago at the time of its completion in 1928 , it remains the city 's most slender high-rise structure at only at its base . the interior space within the upper octagonal spire contains the least square footage per floor of any chicago skyscraper.it was designed by herbert hugh riddle ( 1875–1939 ) , the architect of the chicago theological seminary , as headquarters for the mather stock car company , a builder of rail cars for transporting livestock.its design was greatly influenced by the pioneering chicago zoning ordinance of 1923 , which placed no limit on the height of new buildings as long as the surface area of the structure 's uppermost floor did not exceed 25 % of its footprint . this resulted in a multitude of tall , slender , `` setback '' towers , of which the mather is an extreme and unusual example . the top floor of the octagonal spire has only of floor space.mather company 's founder , alonzo mather ( a descendant of cotton mather ) is said to be responsible for a number of the building 's distinctive design features , including the octagonal tower . initial plans called for construction of a second , identical building on north michigan avenue , behind the mather and connected to it by a ground-floor arcade , but onset of the great depression in 1929 forced its cancellation .
in telecommunications , multiplexing is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium . the aim is to share resources . for example , in telecommunications , several telephone calls may be carried using one wire . multiplexing originated in telegraphy in the 1870s , and is now widely applied in communications . in telephony , george owen squier is credited with the development of telephone multiplexing in 1910.the multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such as a cable . the multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication channel into several logical channels , one for each message signal or data stream to be transferred . a reverse process , known as demultiplexing , extracts the original channels on the receiver end.a device that performs the multiplexing is called a multiplexer ( mux ) , and a device that performs the reverse process is called a demultiplexer ( demux ) .inverse multiplexing ( imux ) has the opposite aim as multiplexing , namely to break one data stream into several streams , transfer them simultaneously over several communication channels , and recreate the original data stream.in computing , i/o multiplexing can also be used to refer to the concept of processing multiple input/output events from a single event loop , with system calls like poll and select ( unix ) .

in the history of christianity , docetism ( from the `` dokeĩn '' `` to seem '' , `` dókēsis '' `` apparition , phantom '' ) is the claim that the phenomenon of jesus , his historical and bodily existence , and above all the human form of jesus , was mere semblance without any true reality . broadly it is taken as the belief that jesus only seemed to be human , and that his human form was an illusion.the word `` dokētaí '' ( `` illusionists '' ) referring to early groups who denied jesus ' humanity , first occurred in a letter by bishop serapion of antioch ( 197–203 ) , who discovered the doctrine in the gospel of peter , during a pastoral visit to a christian community using it in rhosus , and later condemned it as a forgery . it appears to have arisen over theological contentions concerning the meaning , figurative or literal , of a sentence from the gospel of john : `` the word was made flesh '' .docetism was unequivocally rejected at the first council of nicaea in 325 and is regarded as heretical by the catholic church , eastern orthodox church , coptic orthodox church of alexandria and the orthodox tewahedo , and many protestant denominations that accept and hold to the statements of these early church councils .

a cytotoxic t cell ( also known as t , cytotoxic t lymphocyte , ctl , t-killer cell , cytolytic t cell , cd8+ t-cell or killer t cell ) is a t lymphocyte ( a type of white blood cell ) which kills cancer cells , cells that are infected ( particularly with viruses ) , or cells that are damaged in other ways.most cytotoxic t cells express t-cell receptors ( tcrs ) that can recognize a specific antigen . an antigen is a molecule capable of stimulating an immune response and is often produced by cancer cells or viruses.antigens inside a cell are bound to class i mhc molecules , and brought to the surface of the cell by the class i mhc molecule , where they can be recognized by the t cell . if the tcr is specific for that antigen , it binds to the complex of the class i mhc molecule and the antigen , and the t cell destroys the cell.in order for the tcr to bind to the class i mhc molecule , the former must be accompanied by a glycoprotein called cd8 , which binds to the constant portion of the class i mhc molecule . because of this , these t cells are called cd8+ t cells.the affinity between cd8 and the mhc molecule keeps the t cell and the target cell bound closely together during antigen-specific activation . cd8+ t cells are recognized as t cells once they become activated and are generally classified as having a pre-defined cytotoxic role within the immune system . however , cd8+ t cells also have the ability to make some cytokines .

waggle dance is a dance used in beekeeping and ethology for a particular figure-eight dance of the honey bee . by performing this dance , successful foragers can share information about the direction and distance to patches of flowers yielding nectar and pollen , to water sources , or to new nest-site locations with other members of the colony.the waggle dance and the round dance are two forms of dance behaviour that are part of a continuous transition . as the distance between the resource and the hive increases , the round dance transforms into variations of a transitional dance , which , when communicating resources at even greater distances , becomes the waggle dance . in the case of `` apis mellifera ligustica '' , the round dance is performed until the resource is about 10 metres away from the hive , transitional dances are performed when the resource is at a distance of 20 to 30 metres away from the hive , and finally , when it is located at distances greater than 40 metres from the hive , the waggle dance is performed . however , even close to the nest , the round dance can contain elements of the waggle dance , such as a waggle portion . it has therefore been suggested that the term `` waggle dance '' is better for describing both the waggle dance and the round dance.austrian ethologist and nobel laureate karl von frisch was one of the first who translated the meaning of the waggle dance .

potassium–argon dating , abbreviated k-ar dating , is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology and archaeology . it is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium ( k ) into argon ( ar ) . potassium is a common element found in many materials , such as micas , clay minerals , tephra , and evaporites . in these materials , the decay product is able to escape the liquid ( molten ) rock , but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies ( recrystallizes ) . the amount of argon sublimation is a function of the purity of the sample , the composition of the mother material , and a number of other factors . these factors introduce error limits on the upper and lower bounds of dating . final determination of age is reliant on the environmental factors during formation , melting , and exposure to decreased pressure and/or open air.time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of accumulated to the amount of remaining . the long half-life of allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.the quickly cooled lavas that make nearly ideal samples for k-ar dating also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field as the sample cooled past the curie temperature of iron . the geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using k-ar dating .

a well is a well dug in the ground to get water . this is usually done by digging tunnels into the ground and putting in water . well water is pumped through special containers , such as buckets , or by hand . wells have been dug at least eight thousand years ago . they can vary from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of iran , and the stepwells and sakiehs of india . placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability . linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the iron age.wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging , as is the case in rural areas of the developing world . these wells are inexpensive and low-tech . they are covered with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds . a more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete rings that are lowered into the hole . driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure , which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe , after which a pump is installed to collect the water. deeper wells can be dug by hand drilling methods or machine drilling , using a bit in a borehole . drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic . drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location , and deep or confined wells , sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath . a collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the wells . the site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist , or groundwater surveyor . water may be pumped or hand drawn . impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided . well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable . soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out . another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water .

a concurring opinion ( or dissent ) is an opinion in a legal case in certain legal systems written by one or more judges who disagree with the majority opinion of the court which gives rise to its judgment . when not necessarily referring to a legal decision , this can also be referred to as a minority report.dissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions , and are also delivered and published at the same time . a concurring opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law . they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court 's holding should be limited or overturned . in some cases , a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law , and a later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular understanding of the law formerly advocated in dissent . as with concurring opinions , the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often illuminate the precise holding of the majority opinion.the dissent may disagree with the majority for any number of reasons : a different interpretation of the existing case law , the application of different principles , or a different interpretation of the facts . many legal systems do not provide for a concurring opinion and provide the decision without any information about the discussion between judges or its outcome .

a virus is an infectious agent , which lives inside living cells . it is a type of bacteria and archaea . viruses are very small , and are so small that scientists can not see them with a microscope.viruses infect all types of life forms , from animals and plants to microorganisms , such as bacteria and archaea . more than 6,000 virus species have been described in detail . viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on earth . they are the most numerous type of microbiology.when infected , a host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus . viruses are formed of : ( i ) the genetic material by which the virus acts ; ( ii ) a protein coat , the `` capsid '' , which surrounds and protects the genetic material ; and ( iii ) an outside envelope of lipids.the shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures . most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope . they are one hundredth the size of most bacteria.the origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear . some may have evolved from plasmids , pieces of dna that can move between cells ; others may have evolved from bacteria . scientists are considered by some biologists to be a life form , because they carry genetic material , reproduce , and evolve through natural selection . however they lack the key characteristics such as cell structure that are generally considered necessary criteria for life . because they have some but not all such qualities , viruses have been described as `` organisms at the edge of life '' .viruses spread in many ways . one pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors : for example , viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap , such as aphids ; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. influenza viruses are spread by coughing and sneezing . norovirus and rotavirus are common causes of viral gastroenteritis . the infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is less than 100 particles . hiv is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood . the variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its host range . this can be narrow , meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species , or broad , meaning it is capable of infecting many.viral infections in animals accelerate an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus . some viruses also cause aids , hpv infection , and viral hepatitis , evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections . several antiviral drugs have been developed .
a fallacy of division is a fallacy where a person thinks that what is true for one thing must also be true for all or some of its parts . it can also be called mereological fallacy.an example : using mereological fallacy , someone would say : `` if we have a property of some part of a thing , then we must hold it for all or part of it . '' this is a fallacy , but it does not hold . for example : `` if we hold a part of a thing for all of it , and we can not hold it for all of it , then we can hold it for all of it . `` mereological fallacy is about the same inference that properties of a whole are also properties of its parts .

the adrenal glands ( also known as suprarenal glands ) are endocrine glands . they produce a variety of hormones . these include adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol . they are found above the kidneys.each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla . the adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones : the zona glomerulosa , the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.the adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones : mineralocorticoids , glucocorticoids , androgens , and mineralocorticoids ( such as aldosterone ) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance . the glucocorticoids cortisol and cortisone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata ; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression . the innermost layer of the cortex , the zona reticularis , produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs.the production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis , and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells . the medulla produces the catecholamines , which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.a number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland . overproduction of cortisol leads to cushing 's syndrome , whereas insufficient production is associated with addison 's disease . congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms .

the covalent radius , `` r '' , is a measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond . it is usually measured either in picometres ( pm ) or angstroms ( å ) , with 1 å = 100 pm.the sum of the two covalent radii should equal the covalent bond length between two atoms , `` r '' ( ab ) = `` r '' ( a ) + `` r '' ( b ) . moreover , different radii can be introduced for single , double and triple bonds ( r , r and r below ) , in a purely operational sense . these relationships are certainly not exact because the size of an atom is not constant but depends on its chemical environment . for heteroatomic a-b bonds , ionic terms may enter . often the polar covalent bonds are shorter than would be expected on the basis of the sum of covalent radii . tabulated values of covalent radii are either average or idealized values , which nevertheless show a certain transferability between different situations , which makes them useful.the bond lengths `` r '' ( ab ) are measured by x-ray diffraction ( more rarely , neutron diffraction on molecular crystals ) . rotational spectroscopy can also give extremely accurate values of bond lengths . for homonuclear a-a bonds , linus pauling took the covalent radius to be half the single-bond length in the element , e.g . `` r '' ( h-h , in h ) = 74.14 pm so `` r '' ( h ) = 37.07 pm : in practice , it is usual to get an average value from a variety of covalent compounds , although the difference is usually small . sanderson has published a recent set of non-polar covalent radii for the main-group elements , but the availability of large collections of bond lengths , which are more transferable , from the cambridge crystallographic database has made covalent radii obsolete in many situations .
an upset is when the party most people expected to win but that did not happen.an upset is often used when the person or political party that is most likely to win loses or draws/ties a game with an underdog who the majority expected to lose , defying the conventional wisdom . it is often used in reference to beating the betting odds in sports , or beating the opinion polls in electoral politics.the meaning of the word has sometimes been wrongly thought of the surprising defeat of the horse man o ' war by the horse upset ; the term pre-dates that 1919 race by at least several decades . in its sports coverage immediately following upset 's victory , `` the washington post '' wrote , `` one might make all sorts of puns about it being an upset .

plate tectonics ( from the greek `` plateos '' , the lithosphere ) is the movement of seven large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the earth 's lithosphere . tectonic processes began on earth between 3.3 and 3.5 billion years ago . the geoscientific community accepted plate-tectonic theory after seafloor spreading was validated in the late 1950s and early 1960s.the lithosphere , which is the outermost shell of a planet ( the crust and upper mantle ) , is broken into tectonic plates . the earth 's lithosphere is made up of seven or eight major plates ( depending on how they are defined ) and many minor plates . where the plates meet , their relative motion determines the type of boundary : convergent , divergent , or transform . earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain-building , and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries ( or faults ) . the relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100 mm annually.tectonic plates are able to move because the earth 's lithosphere has greater mechanical strength than the underlying asthenosphere . lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection . this is , the slow creeping motion of earth 's solid mantle . plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the movement of the seafloor away from spreading ridges . this is why the continental crust moves away from the ridge . at subduction zones the relatively cold , dense oceanic crust is `` pulled '' or sinks down into the mantle over the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell . another explanation lies in the different forces created by tidal forces of the sun and moon . these factors are still the subject of much debate .

in chemistry and physics , a nucleon is either a proton or a neutron , thought to be a component of the nucleus of an atomic nucleus . the number of nucleons in a nucleus defines an isotope 's mass number . until the 1960s , nucleons were thought to be elementary particles , not made up of smaller parts . now they are known to be composite particles , made of three quarks bound together by the so-called strong interaction . the interaction between two or more nucleons is called internucleon interaction or nuclear force , which is also ultimately caused by the strong interaction . nucleons sit at the boundary where particle physics and nuclear physics overlap . particle physics , particularly quantum chromodynamics , provides the fundamental equations that explain the properties of quarks and of the strong interaction . these equations explain quantitatively how quarks can bind together into protons and neutrons ( and all the other hadrons ) . however , when multiple nucleons are assembled into an atomic nucleus ( nuclide ) , these fundamental equations become too difficult to solve directly . instead , nuclides are studied within nuclear physics , which studies nucleons and their interactions by approximations and models , such as the nuclear shell model . these models can successfully explain nuclide properties , as for example , whether or not a particular nuclide undergoes radioactive decay.the proton and neutron are in a scheme of categories being at once fermions , hadrons and baryons . the proton carries a positive net charge , and the neutron carries a zero net charge ; the proton 's mass is only about 0.13 % less than the neutron 's . so , they can be viewed as two states of the same nucleon , and together form an isospin doublet ( ) . in isospin space , neutrons can be transformed into protons by su ( 2 ) symmetries , and vice versa . these nucleons are acted upon equally by the strong interaction , which is invariant under rotation in isospin space . according to the noether theorem , isospin is conserved with respect to the strong interaction .

the pedal steel guitar is a console type of steel guitar . with pedals and knee levers , it is possible to play more complex music than any previous steel guitar design . like all steel guitars , it can play unlimited glissandi ( sliding notes ) and deep vibrati . pedal steel is most commonly associated with american country music.pedals and knee levers were added to a steel guitar in the 1950s . this allowed the performer to play a major scale without moving the bar . however , it also allows the performer to push the pedals while striking a chord , making passing notes slur or bend up into harmony with existing notes . this creates a unique sound that has been popular in country and western music . it is a sound not previously possible on a non-pedal steel guitar of any type.from its first use in hawaii in the 19th century , the steel guitar sound became popular in the united states in the first half of the 20th century . it spawned a family of instruments designed specifically to be played with the guitar in a horizontal position . the first instrument in this chronology was the hawaiian guitar also called a lap steel . next was a lap steel with a resonator to make it louder . the electric guitar pickup was invented in 1934 . this allows steel guitars to be heard equally with other instruments . electronic amplification enabled the development of the electrified lap steel , then the console steel , and finally the pedal steel guitar.playing the pedal steel has unusual physical requirements . this means that it must be played with both hands , both feet and both knees . however , the only other instrument with similar requirements is the american reed organ . people who developed the instrument include buddy emmons , bud isaacs , zane beck , and paul bigsby . in addition to american country music , the instrument is used in sacred music in the eastern and southern united states ( called sacred steel ) , jazz , and nigerian music .

ngc 520 is a pair of colliding spiral galaxies about 105 million light years away in the constellation pisces . they were discovered by astronomer william herschel on 13 december 1784.halton arp called this the second-brightest very disturbed galaxy in the sky , and it is as bright in the infrared and radio bands as the antennae galaxies . simulations indicate this object consists of two galactic disks that began interacting about 300 million years ago.the system is still in an early stage of its merger , showing two separate velocity systems in the spectra , and two small tails . two galactic nuclei have been detected , and one is an h ii nucleus.the main galactic component is being viewed edge-on , making it fainter in the optical band . the secondary component is brighter but less massive than the main , and is located to the northwest . they are separated by a dark lane of dust.the region of the galaxies outside their nuclei experienced a period of increased star formation roughly around the time they began to interact . two dwarf objects are located near the merging pair . one of them , designated ugc957 , is in the northern tidal tail – it may be the result of the interaction.when viewed in the x-ray band , the interacting galaxies appear around half as luminous as expected given their merger state . analysis of the gas and molecular features suggests the secondary merger component is gas poor . most of the star formation , therefore , took place in the gas-rich main component to the southeast . 15 x-ray sources are detected within the merger , with many of them displaying long-term variability . a large galactic wind is evident , being driven by the starburst activity .

the king 's gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves : white offers a pawn to divert the black e-pawn . if black accepts the gambit , white has two main plans . the first is to play d4 and bxf4 , regaining the gambit pawn with central domination . the alternative plan is to play nf3 and bc4 followed by 0-0 , when the semi-open f-file created after a pawn push to g3 allows white to attack the weakest point in black 's position , the pawn on f7 . theory has shown that , in order to maintain the gambit pawn , black may well be forced to weaken the with moves such as ... g5 or odd piece placement.a downside to the king 's gambit is that white weakens their own king 's position , exposing it to the latent threat of ... qh4+ ( or ) . with a black pawn on f4 , white can not usually respond to the check with g3 , but if the king is forced to move then it also loses the right to castle.the king 's gambit was one of the oldest documented openings . it was examined by the 17th-century italian chess player giulio cesare polerio , and also appears in one of the earliest chess books , luis ramírez de lucena 's `` repetición de amores y arte de ajedrez '' ( 1497 ) . the king 's gambit was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century , when improvements in defensive technique led it to decline in popularity . it is occasionally seen at master level today , as black has several methods to gain , but is still popular at amateur level .

statistics is the study and interpretation of data . when we talk about statistics , we are talking about data from a wide range of places , groups of people , or places . statistics is the science about recording and looking at data . it also includes the design and implementation of surveys and experiments.when data can not be collected , statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples . representative sampling design and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole . an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study , manipulating the system , and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements . in contrast , an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.two main statistical methods are used in data analysis : descriptive statistics , which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation , and inferential statistics , which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation ( e.g. , observational errors , sampling variation ) . descriptive statistics is most often concerned with two sets of properties of a `` distribution '' ( or `` population '' ) : `` central tendency '' ( or `` location '' ) seeks to characterize the distribution 's central or typical value , while `` dispersion '' ( or `` variability '' ) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other . inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of probability theory , which deals with the analysis of random phenomena .

a scar is an area of fibrous tissue that replaces normal skin after an injury . scars result from the biological process of wound repair in the skin , as well as in other organs and tissues of the body . so , scarring is a natural part of the healing process.scarring is composed of the same protein ( collagen ) as the tissue that it replaces . but the fiber composition of the protein is different . instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue , in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction.this collagen scar tissue alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the normal collagen randomised alignment . for example , scars in the skin are less resistant to ultraviolet radiation , and sweat glands and hair follicles do not grow back within scar tissues.scarring causes scar formation in the heart muscle , which leads to loss of muscular power and possibly heart failure . however , there are some tissues ( e.g . bone ) that can heal without any structural or functional deterioration .

the law of the united states is made up of many levels of law that are not created by the constitution . the most important is the united states constitution , which says that the federal government of the united states is based on federal law . the constitution sets out the boundaries of federal law , which consists of acts of congress , treaties ratified by the senate , regulations promulgated by the executive branch , and case law coming from the federal judiciary . the united states code is the official compilation and codification of general and permanent federal statutory law.federal law and treaties , so long as they are in accordance with the constitution , preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 u.s. states and in the territories . however , the scope of federal power is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal . in the dual-sovereign system of american federalism ( actually tripartite because of the presence of indian reservations ) , states are the plenary sovereigns , each with their own constitution , while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the constitution . indeed , states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights . thus , most u.s. law ( especially the actual `` living law '' of contract , tort , property , criminal , and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis ) consists primarily of state law , which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next .

a gravitational singularity , spacetime singularity or simply singularity is where the gravitational field of a celestial body is predicted to become infinite by general relativity . the quantities used to measure gravitational field strength are the scalar invariant curvatures of spacetime , which includes a measure of the density of matter . since such quantities become infinite at the singularity , the laws of normal spacetime break down.gravitational singularities are mainly considered in the context of general relativity , where density apparently becomes infinite at the centre of a black hole , and within astrophysics and cosmology as the earliest state of the universe during the big bang . physicists are undecided whether the prediction of singularities means that they actually exist ( or existed at the start of the big bang ) . current knowledge is insufficient to describe what happens at such extreme densities.general relativity predicts that any object collapsing beyond a certain point ( for stars this is the schwarzschild radius ) would form a black hole , inside which a singularity ( covered by an event horizon ) would be formed . the penrose–hawking singularity theorems define a singularity to have geodesics that can not be extended in a smooth manner . the termination of such a geodesic is considered to be the singularity.the initial state of the universe , at the beginning of the big bang , is also predicted by modern theories to have been a singularity . in this case the universe did not collapse into a black hole , because currently-known calculations and density limits for gravitational collapse are usually based on objects of relatively constant size , such as stars , and do not necessarily apply in the same way to rapidly expanding space such as the big bang . neither general relativity nor quantum mechanics can currently describe the earliest moments of the big bang , but in general , quantum mechanics does not permit particles to inhabit a space smaller than their wavelengths .

in physics , angular velocity is how fast an object moves around or revolves around a point . the amount of angular velocity changes with time . there are two types of angular velocity : orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity.in general , angular velocity is measured in angle per second , e.g . radians per second ( angle replacing distance from linear velocity with time in common ) . the si unit of angular velocity is called radians per second , and the si unit of angular velocity is called radians per second.with a geostationary satellite completes one orbit per day above the equator , or 360 degrees per 24 hours , and has angular velocity `` ω '' = ( 360°/h ) / ( 24 h ) = 15°/h , or ( 2π rad/h ) ≈ 0.26 rad/h.if angle is measured in radians , the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity , formula_1 . with orbital radius 42,000 km from the earth 's center , the satellite 's speed through space is thus `` v '' = 42,000 km × 0.26/h ≈ 11,000 km/h . the angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels eastward with the earth 's rotation ( counter-clockwise from above the north pole ) . ) in three dimensions , angular velocity is a pseudovector , with its magnitude measuring the rate at which an object rotates or revolves , and its direction pointing perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of rotation or angular displacement . the orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the right-hand rule .
a computation is any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and which follows a well-defined model ( e.g . an algorithm ) .mechanical or electronic devices ( or , historically , people ) that perform computations are known as `` computers '' . an especially well-known discipline of the study of computation is computer science .

an oar is an implement used for water-borne propulsion . oars have a flat blade at one end . rowers grasp the oar at the other end.the difference between oars and paddles is that oars are used exclusively for rowing . in rowing the oar is connected to the vessel by means of a pivot point for the oar , either an oarlock , or a thole . the oar is placed in the pivot point with a short portion inside the vessel , and a much larger portion outside . the rower pulls on the short end of oar , while the long end is in the water . the oar is a second class lever with the water as the fulcrum , the oarlock as the load , and the rower as the force . an oar is an unusual lever since the mechanical advantage is less than one . the oar increases the small displacement of the end held by the rower , into a large displacement of the vessel through the water . the rower applies a large force through a small distance , which must be equaled by the small force the water uses over a longer distance . the work done by the rower must be balanced by the work done by the water.by contrast , paddles , are held in both hands by the paddler , and are not attached to the vessel.rowers generally face the stern of the vessel , reach towards the stern , and insert the blade of their oar in the water . as they lean back , towards the vessel 's bow , the blade of their oars pivots in the oarlock , and the end in the water moves towards the stern , providing forward thrust.for thousands of years vessels were powered either by sails , or by the mechanical work of rowers , or by paddlers . some ancient vessels were propelled by both oar and sail , depending on the speed and direction of the wind .

in a musical composition , a chord progression or harmonic progression is a succession of chords . chord progressions are the foundation of harmony in western musical music . they are the foundation of western popular music styles ( e.g. , pop music , rock music ) and traditional music ( e.g. , blues and jazz ) . in these genres , chord progressions are the defining feature on which melody and rhythm are built. chord progressions have the function of establishing or contradicting a tonality , the technical name for what is commonly understood as the `` key '' of a song or piece . chord progressions are usually expressed by roman numerals in classical music theory . for example , the common chord progression i-vi-ii-v.in many styles of popular and traditional music , chord progressions are expressed using the name and `` quality '' of the chords . for example , the previously mentioned chord progression , in the key of c major , would be written as c major-a minor-d minor-g major in a fake book or lead sheet . in the first chord , c major , the `` c '' indicates that the chord is built on the root note `` c '' , and the word `` major '' indicates that a major chord is built on this `` c '' note.rock and blues musicians also often refer to chord progressions using roman numerals . this makes transposing a song to a new key . for example , rock and blues musicians often think of the 12-bar blues as consisting of i , iv , and v chords . so , a simple version of the 12-bar blues might be expressed as i-i-i-i , iv-iv-i-i , v-iv-i-i . by thinking of this blues progression in roman numerals , a backup band or rhythm section could be asked by a bandleader to play the chord progression in any key of c major , or if the bandleader asked the bandleader to play this chord progression in the key of c-c–c–c–c , f-f–c , g-f–c–c–c–c . if the bandleader wanted the song in g major , the chords would be g-g-g–g , c-c–g–g–g , d-c–g–g–g. and so on.some pop and rock songs from the 1980s to the 2010s have fairly simple chord progressions . funk emphasizes the groove and rhythm as the key element , so entire funk songs may be based on one chord . some punk and hardcore punk songs use only a few chords . on the other hand , bebop jazz songs may have 32-bar song forms with one or two chord changes every bar .

the denisovans ( or denisova hominins ) are an extinct species or subspecies of the archaic human that lived in asia during the middle and middle paleolithic ( possibly surviving as late as 30,000–14,500 years ago in new guinea ) . denisovans are known from few remains , and most of what is known about them comes from dna evidence . there have been many different species discovered . `` homo denisova '' , `` h. altaiensis '' , or `` h. sapiens denisova '' is a relative of the neanderthal man.the first denisovan individual was identified in 2010 based on mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) from a juvenile female finger bone from siberian denisova cave . nuclear dna ( ndna ) indicates close affinities with neanderthals . the cave was also periodically inhabited by neanderthals , but is unclear whether they ever cohabited in the cave. additional specimens from denisova cave were later discovered , as was a single specimen from the baishiya karst cave on the tibetan plateau in china . this indicates they lived in a wide variety of habitats , including forests , tundras , mountains and jungles . dna evidence suggests they had dark skin , eyes , and hair , and had a neanderthal-like build and facial features . however , they had larger molars which are somewhat like middle to late pleistocene archaic humans and australopithecines.denisovans apparently interbred with modern humans , with about 3–5 % of the dna of melanesians and aboriginal australians and around 6 % in papuans deriving from denisovans . denisovans may have interbred with modern humans in new guinea as recently as 15,000 years ago . there is also evidence of interbreeding with the local neanderthal population , with about 17 % of the denisovan genome from denisova cave deriving from them . a first generation hybrid nicknamed `` denny '' was discovered with a denisovan father and a neanderthal mother . 4 % of the denisovan genome comes from an unknown archaic human species which diverged from modern humans over one million years ago .

this article contains the results of the 2016 republican presidential primaries and caucuses . it is the process by which the republican party selected delegates to attend the 2016 republican national convention from july 18-21.a simple majority ( 1,237 ) of the total delegate votes ( 2,472 ) was required to become the party 's nominee . the nominee was donald trump of new york.the process began on march 23 , 2015 , when texas senator ted cruz became the first presidential candidate to announce his intentions to seek the office of united states president . that summer , 17 major candidates were recognized by national and state polls . it is the largest presidential candidate field for any single political party in american history.the large field made possible the fact that the 2016 primaries were the first since 1968 ( and the first in which every state won at least one state ) in which more than three candidates won at least one state.when voting began in the 2016 iowa caucuses , twelve major candidates were being considered . these included former governor mike huckabee of arkansas , former senator rick santorum of pennsylvania , governor chris christie of new jersey , businesswoman and former hewlett-packard chief executive officer carly fiorina , former governor jim gilmore of virginia , governor jeb bush of florida , former neurosurgeon and johns hopkins university director of pediatric neurosurgery ben carson , senator marco rubio of florida , senator ted cruz of texas , governor john kasich of ohio , and businessman and ceo donald trump of new york.after poor results from the first-in-the-nation caucus , ben carson dropped out of the race , santorum also ended his campaign after a poor performance in iowa , and subsequently polling poorly leading into the new hampshire primary . christie , who put nearly all of his campaign 's resources into the critical state of new hampshire , withdrew on february 10 , 2016 after finishing sixth in the state . following christie 's announcement , fiorina suspended her campaign , which was unable to gain traction . gilmore , who severely lacked funding , campaign infrastructure , and support , surprised many political journalists by staying in the race as far as he did ; he dropped out shortly after the new hampshire primary . after super tuesday , carson announced that there would be `` no path forward '' for his bid for the presidency , effectively ending his campaign . on march 15 , 2016 , rubio dropped out from the race , leaving three active candidates ( cruz , kasich , and trump ) . trump 's resounding victory in the indiana primary on may 3 , 2016 , prompted cruz 's exit from the race . the following day , trump became the presumptive republican nominee after kasich dropped out . trump was formally nominated by the delegates of the 2016 republican national convention on july 19 , 2016 , and started the general election on november 19 , 2016 , to defeat democratic nominee hillary clinton in the general election on november 8 , 2016 , to become the 45th president of the united states .

nuclear weapons testing , uranium mining and export , and nuclear power have often been the subject of public debate in australia , and the anti-nuclear movement in australia has a long history . its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over french nuclear testing in the pacific and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in australia.several groups concerned with nuclear issues were established in the mid-1970s , including the movement against uranium mining and campaign against nuclear energy ( cane ) , friends of the earth and the australian conservation foundation . the movement suffered a setback in 1983 when the newly elected labor government failed to implement its stated policy of stopping uranium mining . by the late 1980s , the price of uranium had fallen , the costs of nuclear power had risen , and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case ; cane was disbanded in 1988.about 2003 , proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to global warming and the australian government began taking an interest . anti-nuclear campaigners and some scientists in australia argued that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources , and that uranium mining itself could become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.as of 2015 , australia has no nuclear power stations and five uranium mines , four of which are in south australia .

'' the visitor added that this was a belief `` daily gaining adherents '' .in october 1859 , brown led a group of volunteers to the federal armory in harpers ferry , virginia ( today west virginia ) . he hoped to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the regions of virginia and north carolina . when there was a provisional constitution for the state he hoped to establish , he seized the armory , but seven people were killed , and ten or more were injured . brown intended to arm slaves with weapons from the armory , but only a small number of local slaves joined his revolt . within 36 hours , those of brown 's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers , militiamen , and u.s. marines . the men were led by robert e. lee . brown was tried for treason against the commonwealth of virginia , the murder of five men , and inciting a slave insurrection ; he was found guilty on all counts and was hanged . brown was the first person executed for treason in the history of the united states.the history of the harpers ferry raid and brown 's trial were covered extensively by the national press . the events that led to the south 's secession a year later , and the american civil war . brown 's raid captured the nation ; southerners feared that it was just the first of many northern plots to cause a slave rebellion that might endanger their lives . republicans , among them president lincoln , distanced themselves from abolitionism and asserted that they would not interfere with slavery in the south . brown 's body was a popular union marching song that portrayed him as a heroic martyr .

kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp , which covers about 25 % of the world 's coastlines . they are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on earth . smaller areas of kelp are called kelp beds.kelp forests occur worldwide throughout temperate and polar coastal oceans . in 2007 , kelp forests were also discovered in tropical waters near ecuador.physically formed by brown macroalgae , kelp forests provide a unique habitat for marine organisms and are a source for understanding many ecological processes.for the last century , they have been the focus of extensive research , particularly in trophic ecology , and continue to provoke important ideas that are relevant beyond this unique ecosystem . for example , kelp forests can influence coastal oceanographic patterns and provide many ecosystem services.however , the influence of humans has often contributed to kelp forest degradation . of particular concern are the effects of overfishing nearshore ecosystems , which can release herbivores from their normal population regulation and result in the overgrazing of kelp and other algae . this can rapidly result in transitions to barren landscapes where relatively few species persist .

cuneiform was the writing system invented by sumerians in ancient mesopotamia . it was one of the first writing systems to be able to be read . it is known for its wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets , made by means of a blunt reed for a stylus . the term `` cuneiform '' comes from `` cuneus '' , latin for `` wedge '' . cuneiform was used in sumer to convey the sumerian language . cuneiform writing began as a system of pictograms . later , the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters used decreased ( hittite cuneiform ) . the system is a combination of logophonetic , consonantal alphabetic , and syllabic signs.the original sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the semitic akkadian ( assyrian/babylonian ) , eblaite and amorite languages , the language isolates elamite , hattic , hurrian and urartian , as well as indo-european languages hittite and luwian ; it inspired the later semitic ugaritic alphabet as well as old persian cuneiform . cuneiform was gradually replaced by the phoenician alphabet during the neo-assyrian empire ( 911–612 bc ) . by the second century , the script had become extinct , its last traces being found in assyria and babylonia , and all knowledge of how to read it was lost until it began to be deciphered in the 19th century.geoffrey sampson stated that egyptian hieroglyphs `` came into existence a little after sumerian script , and , probably , [ were ] invented under the influence of the latter '' , and that it is `` probable that the general idea of expressing words of a language in writing was brought to egypt from sumerian mesopotamia '' . there are many instances of egypt-mesopotamia relations at the time of the invention of writing , and standard reconstructions of the development of egyptian hieroglyphs , were the development of the sumerian hieroglyphs before the development of egyptian hieroglyphs.between half a million and two million cuneiform tablets are believed to have been excavated in modern times , of which only about 30,000–100,000 have been read or published . the british museum holds the largest collection ( 130,000 ) , followed by the vorderasiatisches museum berlin , the louvre , the istanbul archaeology museums , the national museum of iraq , the yale babylonian collection ( 40,000 ) , and penn museum . most of these have `` lain in these collections for a century without being translated , studied or published '' , as there are only a few hundred qualified cuneiformists in the world .

the name army ant ( or legionary ant or marabunta ) is applied to over 200 ant species in different lineages . due to their aggressive predatory foraging groups , known as `` raids '' , a huge number of ants forage simultaneously over a certain area.another shared feature is that , unlike most ant species , army ants do not make permanent nests ; an army ant colony moves almost incessantly over the time it exists . all species are members of the true ant family , formicidae , but several groups have independently evolved the same basic behavioural and ecological syndrome . this syndrome is often referred to as `` legionary behaviour '' , and may be an example of convergent evolution.the largest genus is `` neivamyrmex '' , which contains more than 120 species ; the most predominant species is `` eciton burchellii '' ; its common name `` army ant '' is considered to be the archetype of the species . old world army ants are divided between the aenictini and dorylini tribes . aenictini contains more than 50 species of army ants in the single genus , `` aenictus '' . however , the dorylini contain the genus `` dorylus '' , the most aggressive group of driver ants ; 70 species are known.originally , some of the old world and new world lineages of army ants were thought to have evolved independently . however , genetic analysis of various species suggests that several of these groups evolved from a single common ancestor , which lived about 100 million years ago at the time of the separation of the continents of africa and south america , while other army ant lineages ( leptanillinae , plus members of ponerinae , amblyoponinae , and myrmicinae ) are still considered to represent independent evolutionary events . army ant taxonomy remains in flux , and genetic analysis will continue to provide more information about the relatedness of the various taxa .

geochronology is the science of determining the age of rocks , fossils , and sediments using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves . absolute geochronology can be done through radioactive isotopes . relative geochronology is provided by tools such as palaeomagnetism and stable isotope ratios . by combining multiple geochronological ( and biostratigraphic ) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.geochronology is different in application from biostratigraphy , which is the science of assigning sedimentary rocks to a known geological period by describing , cataloging and comparing fossil floral and faunal assemblages . biostratigraphy does not `` directly '' provide an absolute age determination of a rock , but merely places it within an `` interval '' of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted . both disciplines work together hand in hand , however , to the point where they share the same system of naming strata ( rock layers ) and the time spans used to classify sublayers within a stratum.the science of geochronology is the prime tool used in the discipline of chronostratigraphy , which attempts to derive absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages , and determine the geologic history of the earth and extraterrestrial bodies .

atlantis is a fictional island mentioned in plato 's `` timaeus '' and `` critias '' . it is the antagonist naval power that besieges `` ancient athens '' . in the story , athens repels the atlantean attack , unlike any other nation of the known world . the atlantean attack is said to be evidence of the superiority of plato 's idea of a state . the story ends with atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the atlantic ocean.atlantis was only very minor in plato 's work . however , the atlantis story has had a large impact on literature . the allegorical aspect of atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several renaissance writers , such as francis bacon 's `` new atlantis '' and thomas more 's `` utopia '' . on the other hand , nineteenth-century amateur scholars thought thought plato 's narrative was historical tradition , mostly ignatius l. donnelly . plato 's vague indications of the time of the events—more than 9,000 years before his time—and the alleged location of atlantis— '' beyond the pillars of hercules '' – led to much pseudoscientific speculation . as a result , atlantis has become a byword for any supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations , and continues to inspire contemporary fiction , from comic books to films.while present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story 's fictional character , there is still debate on what served as its inspiration . for example , plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions . this led a number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of atlantis from egyptian records of the thera eruption , the sea peoples invasion , or the trojan war . others have rejected this chain of tradition , drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed athenian invasion of sicily in 415–413 bc or the destruction of helike in 373 bc .

the liberal party was one of the two major political parties in the united kingdom with the opposing conservative party in the 19th and early 20th centuries.the party arose from an alliance of whigs and free trade-supporting peelites and the reformist radicals in the 1850s . by the end of the 19th century it had formed four governments under william gladstone . despite being divided over the issue of irish home rule , the party returned to government in 1905 and then won a landslide victory in the following year 's general election.under prime ministers henry campbell-bannerman ( 1905–1908 ) and h. h. asquith ( 1908–1916 ) , the liberal party passed the welfare reforms that created a basic british welfare state . although asquith was the party 's leader , its dominant figure was david lloyd george . asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister and lloyd george replaced him as prime minister in late 1916 , but asquith remained as liberal party leader.the two fought for years over control of the party , badly weakening it in the process . in `` the oxford companion to british history '' , historian martin pugh argues : the government of lloyd george was dominated by the conservative party , which finally deposed him in 1922 . by the end of the 1920s , the labour party had replaced the liberals as the conservatives ' main rival . the liberal party went into decline after 1918 and by the 1950s won no more than six seats at general elections . apart from notable by-election victories , its fortunes did not improve significantly until it formed the sdp–liberal alliance with the newly formed social democratic party ( sdp ) in 1981.at the 1983 general election , the alliance won a quarter of the vote , but only 23 of the 650 seats it contested . at the 1987 general election , its share of the vote fell below 23 % and the liberals and social democratic party merged in 1988 to form the liberal democrats .

nazi germany used six extermination camps ( ) , also called death camps , or killing centers , in central europe during the holocaust in world war ii to systematically murder over 2.7 million people , mostly jews , during the holocaust . the victims of death camps were primarily killed by gassing , either in permanent installations constructed for this specific purpose , or by means of gas vans.the six extermination camps were chelmno , belzec , sobibor , treblinka , majdanek and auschwitz-birkenau . auschwitz and majdanek death camps also used extreme work under starvation conditions in order to kill their prisoners.the idea of mass extermination with the use of stationary facilities , to which the victims were taken by train , was the result of earlier nazi experimentation with chemically manufactured poison gas during the aktion t4 euthanasia programme against hospital patients with mental and physical disabilities . the technology was adapted , expanded and applied in wartime to unsuspecting victims of many ethnic and national groups . the jews were the main target , accounting for over 90 % of the extermination camp death toll . the genocide of the jews of europe was the third reich 's `` final solution to the jewish question '' .

in set theory is a set theory named after mathematicians ernst zermelo and abraham fraenkel . it was proposed in the early 20th century to make a theory of sets free of paradoxes such as russell 's paradox . today , zermelo–fraenkel set theory , with the axiom of choice ( ac ) included , is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and is the most common foundation of mathematics . zermelo–fraenkel set theory refers only to pure sets and prevent its models from containing urelements ( elements of sets that are not themselves sets ) . also , proper classes ( collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members where the collections are too big to be sets ) can only be treated indirectly.the axioms of zermelo–fraenkel set theory state the existence of particular sets defined from other sets . for example , the axiom of pairing says that given any two sets formula_1 and formula_2 there is a new set formula_2 containing exactly formula_1 and formula_2 . other axioms describe properties of set membership . a goal of the axioms is that each axiom should be true if a statement about the collection of all sets in the von neumann universe ( also known as the cumulative hierarchy ) . formally , zfc is a one-sorted theory in first-order logic . the signature has equality and a single primitive binary relation , set membership , which is usually denoted formula_6 . the formula_7 means that the set formula_2 is a member of the set formula_2 ( which is also read , `` formula_1 is an element of formula_2 '' or `` formula_1 is in formula_2 '' ) .the metamathematics of zermelo–fraenkel set theory has been extensively studied . landmark results in this area established the logical independence of the axiom of choice from the remaining zermelo-fraenkel set theory ( see axiom of choice # independence ) and of the continuum hypothesis from zermelo-fraenkel set theory . the consistency of a theory such as zfc can not be proved within the theory itself , as shown by gödel 's second incompleteness theorem .

mortality rate , or death rate , is a measure of the number of deaths ( in general , or due to a specific cause ) in a particular population . it is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year.an important specific mortality rate measure is the crude death rate , which looks at mortality from all causes in a given time interval for a given population . , for example , the cia estimated that the crude death rate globally will be 7.7 deaths per 1,000 persons in a population per year.mortality rate is different from `` morbidity '' , which is either the prevalence or incidence of a disease , and also from the incidence rate ( the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time ) .
an economic bubble or asset bubble ( sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble , a market bubble , a price bubble , a financial bubble , or a balloon ) is a situation in which asset prices appear to be false . the situation could also be described as trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeded the asset 's intrinsic value.while some economists deny that bubbles occur , the causes of bubbles remain disputed by those who are convinced that asset prices often deviate strongly from intrinsic values.many explanations have been suggested , and research has recently shown that bubbles may appear even without uncertainty , speculation , or bounded rationality , in which case they can be called non-speculative bubbles or sunspot equilibria . in such cases , the bubbles may be argued to be rational , where investors at every point are fully compensated for the possibility that the bubble might collapse by higher returns . these approaches require that the timing of the bubble collapse can only be forecast probabilistically , and the bubble process is often modelled using a markov switching model . similar explanations suggest that bubbles might ultimately be caused by processes of price coordination . these events are sociologically driven , for example , events of emerging social norms and the role that culturally-situated stories or narratives play in these events.since it is often difficult to observe intrinsic values in real-life markets , bubbles are often proven only in retrospect . once a sudden drop in prices has occurred , such a drop is known as a `` crash '' or a `` bubble burst '' . in an economic bubble , prices can fluctuate erratically and become impossible to predict from supply and demand alone.asset bubbles are now widely regarded as a recurrent feature of modern economic history dating back as far as the 1600s . the dutch golden age 's tulip mania ( in the mid-1630s ) is often considered the first recorded economic bubble.both the boom and the bust phases of the bubble are examples of a positive feedback mechanism ( in contrast to the negative feedback mechanism that determines the equilibrium price under normal market circumstances ) .

in physics ( specifically , celestial mechanics ) , escape velocity is the speed needed for a free , non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a massive body , that is , to achieve an infinite distance from it.the escape velocity is a function of the mass of the body and distance to the center of mass of the body.a rocket , continuously accelerated by its exhaust , need not reach ballistic escape velocity at any distance since it is supplied with additional kinetic energy by the expulsion of its reaction mass . it can achieve escape at any speed , given a suitable mode of propulsion and sufficient propellant to provide the accelerating force on the object to escape.the escape velocity from earth 's surface is about . once the escape velocity is achieved , no further impulse need be applied for it to continue in its escape . in other words , if given escape velocity , the object will move away from the other body , slowing , and never to come back . speeds higher than escape velocity have a positive speed at infinity . note that the minimum escape velocity assumes there is no friction ( e.g. , atmospheric drag ) which would increase the required speed to escape the gravitational influence , and that there will be no further impulse need to be applied for it to continue in its escape . in other words , if given a given escape velocity , the object will move away from the other body , slowing , and will asymptotically approach zero speed as the object 's distance approaches infinity , never to come back .

extensive reading or reading for pleasure is a way of language learning , including foreign language learning , through large amounts of reading . as well as facilitating acquisition of vocabulary , it is believed to increase motivation through positive affective benefits . it is believed that extensive reading is an important factor in education . proponents such as stephen krashen ( 1989 ) claim that reading alone will increase literacy opportunities by inferencing . the learner 's encounters with unknown words in specific contexts will allow the learner to guess and thus learn those words ' meanings . while the mechanism is commonly accepted as true , its importance in language learning is disputed.extensive reading is contrasted with `` intensive reading '' , which is slow , careful reading of a small amount of difficult text – it is when one is `` focused on the language rather than the text '' . extensive and intensive reading are two approaches to language learning and instruction , and may be used concurrently ; intensive reading is , however , the more common approach , and often the only one used.extensive reading has been used and advocated in language learning since at least the 19th century ( with latin ; see below ) . in the first language , many connections have been made between reading and vocabulary size , as well as other academic skills .
the aldol reaction is a way of making carbon–carbon bonds in organic chemistry . it was discovered independently by russian chemist alexander borodin in 1869 and by french chemist charles-adolphe wurtz in 1872 . the reaction combines two carbonyl compounds to form a new β-hydroxy carbonyl compound . these products are known as aldols , from the `` ald '' ehyde + alcoh ol , a structural motif seen in many of the products . aldol structural units are found in many important molecules , whether naturally occurring or synthetic . for example , the aldol reaction has been used in the large-scale production of the commodity chemical pentaerythritoland the synthesis of the heart disease drug lipitor ( atorvastatin , calcium salt ) .the aldol reaction unites two relatively simple molecules into a more complex one . higher complexity arises because up to two new stereogenic centers ( on the α- and β-carbon of the aldol adduct , marked with asterisks in the scheme below ) are formed . modern methodology can not only allow aldol reactions to proceed in high yield but also controlling both the relative and absolute configuration of these stereocenters . this ability to selectively synthesize a particular stereoisomer is significant because different stereoisomers can have very different chemical and biological properties .

in mathematics , the geometric mean is an average . it is the normal value of a set of numbers . the geometric mean is the th root of the product of numbers . for example , the geometric mean of two numbers , say 2 and 8 , is the square root of their product , that is , formula_2 . as another example , the geometric mean of the three numbers 4 , 1 , and 1/32 is the cube root of their product ( 1/8 ) , which is 1/2 , that is , formula_3.the geometric mean can be used when comparing different items . it can be used when finding a single `` figure of merit '' for these items , when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges . for example , the geometric mean can give a meaningful value to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability , and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability . if an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean , the financial viability would have greater weight because its numeric range is larger . that is , a small percentage change in the financial rating ( e.g . going from 80 to 90 ) makes a much larger change in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability ( e.g . going from 2 to 5 ) . the use of a geometric mean normalizes the differently-ranged values , meaning a given percentage change in any of the properties has the same effect on the geometric mean . so , a 20 % change in environmental sustainability from 4 to 4.8 has the same effect on the geometric mean as a 20 % change in financial viability from 60 to 72.the geometric mean of two numbers , formula_4 and formula_5 , is the length of one side of a square whose area is equal to the area of a rectangle with sides of lengths formula_5 and formula_6 . similarly , the geometric mean of three numbers , formula_6 , is the length of one edge of a cube whose volume is the same as that of a cube with sides whose lengths are equal to the three given numbers .

the flatworms are a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian animals . unlike other bilaterian animals , they do not have a body cavity , and they do not have specialized circulatory and respiratory organs . they have flattened shapes that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by diffusion . free-living flatworms are mostly predators , and live in water or in shaded , humid terrestrial environments , such as leaf litter . cestodes ( tapeworms ) and trematodes ( flukes ) have complex life-cycles , with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates , and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts . the eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts , whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic , segment-like proglottids that detach when mature , are excreted , and then release eggs . unlike the other parasitic groups , the monogeneans were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians ( animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends ) . however , analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup , the acoelomorpha , as basal bilaterians – closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups . the remaining platyhelminthes form a monophyletic group , one that contains all and only descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the group . the redefined platyhelminthes are part of the lophotrochozoa , one of the three main groups of more complex bilaterians . these analyses have ended the redefined platyhelminthes , including two monophyletic subgroups , catenulida and rhabditophora . so , the traditional platyhelminth subgroup `` turbellaria '' is now regarded as paraphyletic , since it excludes the completely parasitic groups , although these are descended from one group of `` turbellarians '' .two planarian species have been used successfully in the philippines , indonesia , hawaii , new guinea , and guam to control populations of the imported african snail `` achatina fulica '' , which was displacing native snails . these planarians are themselves a serious threat to native snails and should be used for biological control .

 christian science is a group of beliefs associated with members of the church of christ , scientist . they are known as christian scientists or students of christian science . the church is sometimes informally known as the christian science church . it originated in 19th-century new england , where mary baker eddy explained in her 1875 book `` science and health '' that sickness can be healed by prayer . the book became christian science 's central text , along with the bible , and has sold over nine million copies.eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter in 1879 to found the church of christ , scientist , and in 1894 the mother church , the first church of christ , scientist , was built in boston , massachusetts . christian science became the fastest growing religion in the united states , with nearly 270,000 members there by 1936 , a figure that declined by 1990 to just over 100,000 , and by 2009 reportedly to under 50,000.the church publishes a newspaper , `` the christian science monitor '' , which won seven pulitzer prizes between 1950 and 2002 , and runs reading rooms around the world.eddy described christian science as a return to `` primitive christianity and its lost element of healing '' . there are key differences between christian science theology and that of traditional christianity . in particular , adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism , believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion . this includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder , and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.the church does not require that christian scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists , optometrists , obstetricians , physicians for broken bones , and are open to vaccination especially when required by law—but maintains that christian science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine . critics of christian science blame the religion 's avoidance of medical treatment for the deaths of several adherents and their children between the 1880s and 1990s .

in mathematics , the mediant of two fractions is generally made up of four positive integersthat is to say , the numerator and denominator of the mediant are the sums of the numerators and denominators of the given fractions , respectively . it is sometimes called the freshman sum , as it is a common mistake in the early stages of learning about addition of fractions.technically , this is a binary operation on valid fractions , considered as ordered pairs of appropriate integers , a priori disregarding the perspective on rational numbers as equivalence classes of fractions . for example , the mediant of the fractions 1/1 and 1/2 is 2/3 . however , if the fraction 1/1 is replaced by the fraction 2/2 , which is an equivalent fraction denoting the same rational number , the mediant of the fractions 2/2 and 1/2 is 3/4 . for a stronger connection to rational numbers the fractions may be reduced to lowest terms , thus selecting unique representatives from the respective equivalence classes.the stern-brocot tree provides an enumeration of all positive rational numbers in lowest terms , obtained purely by iterative computation of the mediant according to a simple algorithm .

granzymes are serine proteases released by cytoplasmic granules in cytotoxic t cells and natural killer ( nk ) cells.they cause cell death ( apoptosis ) in the target cell , by eliminating cells that have become cancerous or are infected with viruses or bacteria . granzymes also kill bacteria and inhibit viral replication.in nk cells and t cells , granzymes are packaged in cytotoxic granules with perforin . granzymes can also be detected in the rough endoplasmic reticulum , golgi complex , and the trans-golgi reticulum.the contents of the cytotoxic granules function to allow entry of the granzymes into the target cell cytosol . the granules are released into an immune synapse formed with a target cell , where perforin mediates the delivery of the granzymes into endosomes in the target cell , and finally into the target cell cytosol.granzymes are closely related to other immune serine proteases expressed by innate immune cells , such as neutrophil elastase and cathepsin g.granzyme b activates apoptosis by apoptosis by apoptosis by apoptosis ( especially caspase-3 ) , which cleaves many substrates , including caspase-activated dnase to execute cell death . granzymes also cleaves the protein bid , which recruits the proteins bax and bak to change the membrane permeability of the mitochondria , causing the release of cytochrome c ( one of the parts needed to activate caspase-9 via the apoptosome ) , smac/diablo and omi/htra2 ( which suppress the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins ( iaps ) ) , among other proteins.the other granzymes activate cell death by caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms.in addition to killing their target cells , granzymes can target and kill intracellular pathogens . granzymes also cleaves components of the electron transport chain , while granzyme b cleaves viral proteins to inhibit viral activation and replication . the granzymes bind directly to the nucleic acids dna and rna ; this enhances their cleavage of nucleic acid binding proteins .
