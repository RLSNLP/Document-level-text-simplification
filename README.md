The repository contains the dataset and the code of the paper: Document-Level Text Simplification: Dataset, Criteria and Baseline (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05071.pdf).

The Dataset folder contains the training set, validation set and test set of the D-Wikipedia dataset. src denotes the file containing the original articles, tgt denotes the file containing the simplified articles, and each line in the file denotes one article.
